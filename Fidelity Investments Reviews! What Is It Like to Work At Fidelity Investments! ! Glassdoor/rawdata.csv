The breadth of this company provides a great opportunity to try out different career paths or boost your current one.,Cons,"In my current role, I am working overtime more often than I'd like with recognition that seems to only go so far until it sizzles out. That may be tied to the size of the company itself, where promotions work in a ""trickle down"" manner.",226

Or so I'm told honestly I don't understand why we don't have a single payer system it's insane that to have health care you need a stable job.  Don't even get me started on dental... What are they?  Luxury bones?,Cons,"Despite the fact that the average employee of this company can't even power on a computer my role is the lowest paid in the company.

To be clear the folks who work from home taking chats/calls who escalate their tickets to my team make more than my team. 

Let's talk numbers.

Inflation in 2021 was around 9% but the average raise for my team was 2%.

2022 was again around 9... But we got a whopping 7%.

That's a pay cut baby.  When we spoke to our leadership they literally told us to go find another job.

What's more is there is no out. You are trapped in this role forever or until you find something better elsewhere.  They offer programs to ""help you progress."" but then banish the techs because they don't want tech people. 

They also abuse the ever living crap out of contractors.  They want you as an employee handling people with millions of dollars in trades laptops but they don't wanna give health care.  Incredible.",3

Great benefits as well.,Cons,"They claim that there are so many different opportunities to grow within the company, but make it impossible to explore those options due to working a strict schedule on the phones. The call volume is back to back with no room to breathe in between calls. You go through 3 months of training and still feel confused at the end. They encourage you to ask questions and reach out for help, but when you reach out for help, you're reprimanded for doing so. You have no say so in your schedule and you have to work between 12pm-8pm so say goodbye to having any type of social life. They offer free therapy and after working there for about a week, you'll quickly understand why.",3
Let Go While 7 Months Pregnant,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW80985681.htm,1.0,"Oct 16, 2023",Financial Consultant I,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Chicago, IL",Pros,I was drawn to the training program for the Financial Consultant role. Good 401k match.,Cons,"I was in a 1 year training program for the Financial Consultant role while completing my CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ certification. I was told I needed to sell more insurance, annuities, and managed accounts in order to continue on as a Financial Consultant. I was let go as soon as I hit the 1 year mark, shortly after I became a CFP® professional. I had told HR that I was pregnant when I became concerned about losing my job and asked to be considered for a different role within Fidelity (since I knew I would not be able to interview and start another job at 7 months pregnant). After I was let go by my manager, I reached back out to HR and they were not even aware that my employment was being terminated. Everyone I dealt with at Fidelity was extremely insensitive to the fact that this would cause a huge amount of stress to me and my family at a time that stress had serious potential health risks to myself and my baby. I ended up being unemployed for close to 9 months. I was interviewing for new jobs while also taking care of a newborn and paying extremely high premiums for health insurance for my family. Only 23% of CFP professionals are women, and only about 15% of financial advisors are women. Even though Fidelity touts its family values and culture, I would not recommend Fidelity to women based on my experience.",18

The onboarding managers openly compare you to others, bring up personal things in 1 on 1s about other associates and make comments about your life like suggesting you should be married or have children by now. They yell at you on the floor in front of the entire facility if you do something they don't like. The don't advocate for people who have disabilities when it comes to learning the material so you're constantly compared to others openly. They require you to work multiple hours a week UNPAID after your schedule and on weekends. They SUGGEST you should work through your breaks and lunches.",2

These can be challenging to balance at times, but they do their best and are mostly successful at it. Flexible work schedules is primary reason Fidelity is retaining a lot of their talent. It's for these reasons I've been with the company almost 20 years and plan to retire here if possible.",Cons,"Lately the company has been getting a little political and pushing some activist type initiatives, which doesn't sit well with many employees. They of course won't speak up and say much, especially ones who've been around a while. The company needs to stick to financial matters and stay away from woke agendas or they may face backlash even if their intentions are sound.",2

Career opportunities are ongoing and the vast majority of people at the firm will help you progress if you're willing to do the work.
Fidelity provides exceptional benefits with options based on personal needs and various family situations.

Their 401k match and profit sharing is impressive. Great starting place for a career. Career mobility is available yet there can be ceilings for advancement. Their products and platform solutions are also quite good. Truly a client centric organization and is focused on maintaining that perception. Their approach during Covid was pretty level-headed.,Cons,"Consistent theme where senior mgmt proved to be disinterested and detached from the happenings on the ground. In retrospect, there is also an unhealthy fear within the workforce. There was always a worry about a rumored layoff and then those that always make a point to ‘appear busy.’ Often you will hear from peers or managers that the grass isn’t always greener or that you should think twice before leaving. Other comments regarding excessive workload expectations and having a stressful work environment are also understated. That is pretty consistent across the channels.",3

Secondly, Fidelity places a strong emphasis on professional development, offering numerous opportunities for career growth and skill enhancement.

PTO is about five work weeks. Managers are very understanding of your personal life. Career development is great; you get promoted quickly. They also have a ""Fidelity Made"" program for people interested in tech.",Cons,"Upper leadership doesn't listen to employees. Every quarter, they require employees to come into the office more and more, and they took away the free meal on top of that. So you end up spending a lot of money going to work.

The company really believes, if you're a well rounded individual- your satisfaction will be mirrored in the client's satisfaction.",Cons,"Pay is lower starting out than other companies, but the benefits and work/life balance (only required to be in office 1 week out of the month) more than makes up for the lower pay. while the company is working to create a more equitable workspace, the employees themselves are often clicky (whether it's religious or gender based).

Gone is the autonomy and flexibility as ""Big Brother"" started watching your every badge swipe. Go ahead take PTO during a Connect Week, but be prepared to have to make those days up in the office. The required in-office attendance wasn't really helping with collaboration, associates kept earbuds in and to themselves anyway and still attended all meetings virtually.

About 20 PTO days, benefits, lots of perks like a concierge you can call to help with anything. 2.) My managers were very good at communicating and looking out for my mental health. I was going through licensing for a call center role and was getting a little burnt out. One of my managers even had a real talk with me about how hard the role was and supported my decision to leave the company. The managers are the real gems.",Cons,"1.) Fidelity requires associates to be in one week every month. Though it was nice to work from home most of the time, the in office week was required and NOT flexible. Sometimes I had to use my PTO days because I was sick and couldn't make it to the office. I would rather be in the office any 5 days of my choosing. 2.) Licensing is hard. Many people left because they couldn't pass the tests (including me). I was in training long enough to see what my role looked like after licensing and it only gets harder. 2.) If you're in the CRA role, please read this first. Do you really want to stay in a job where it's just one call after the other, no idea what it's going to be about, no idea if the client is going to scream at you, and thrown into it without any real training? Fidelity training is very long but does not go over every scenario there is; they expect you to know 100 things while doing something as simple as phone calls. Most of them were password resets or transfers to branches and while most clients were very pleasant, there were some that were outright abusive. I don't blame them as it's managing their money but some could ruin your day. I would not doubt it if my role was completely taken over by AI in a few years. Licensing was fine but once you get to the job it is very overwhelming and exhausting. I knew some coworkers who said that it was very stressful learning so much while also not knowing everything. There just isn't enough time fit everything in your schedule. This was what my day was like when taking calls for two weeks: - 8am: 30 minute team meeting (sometimes this was at 4:30 depending on schedule) - 8:30am: start calls for the day - 10:30am: take 15 min break - 12pm: break for lunch - 1pm: start calls again - 3:30pm: take 30 minute break - 5pm: end day I could take a 45 min break which is measured to the minute while lunch after training is only a half hour. Your whole day will just be phone calls. On my worst day I took about 40 but I've known people who took 60. Even just two days on the phones burnt me out so much.",7

This is strictly a sales role and very minimally a planning role. I think if upper management knew how investor centers were being run and how churning clients and quick selling was being pushed they would be disturbed. Clients usually sell out of managed money within 5 years bc they were falsely sold, they’ve had advisor turnover once or twice in that timeframe, and managed accounts underperform their own asset manager funds.

Everyone is really friendly and helpful, and I always felt like I could find someone to go to if I ever didn't know the answer to something.",Cons,"After training I was assigned a permanent shift which was completely terrible. They offer a shift-bid but it's based on tenure and not time bid. So if you bid monthly to try and get a new shift 20 times in a row, and then someone who's just been there longer decides they want a new shift at the same time... they're getting it. I worked 4x10 M, W, F, Sa from 12:30 - 11pm.

It's back to back calls with not even a 1 second break between calls, you have to follow your schedule down to the second or you ""schedule adherence"" will mess up, can't be under 88% out of a capped out 94% scale or you get in trouble.

They actively try to keep a pc work environment, beyond the virtue signaling you usually see at large corporations, it’s been a nice change of pace feeling like you are truly in a seemingly inert workplace. The expectation for hourly roles is: you clock in on the dot and punch out on the dot without pressure to work extra. They respect your boundaries in this way which is appreciated. The way licensing was structured was nice, you study 90% of the week then come in for a half a day of phones to keep those skills somewhat ready for when you pass. Overall if you’re a recent college grad or looking to make a career transition from another industry this isn’t a bad place to be, you’ll likely get an offer because they have a lot of seats to fill and a decent amount of turnover at the 1-2 year mark.",Cons,"I have worked in other industries and other large corporations before coming to Fidelity, if you’re new to the workforce or new to working for a decent large corp this experience may seem amazing but it’s mostly external and internal marketing driving that narrative. Most of the 5 star reviews for this role specifically must be from somewhat naive folks or folks that can’t see through the “lifestyle” aspects of the culture and can’t see it for what it really is. The recruiter described the training program as “world class” explaining it would be this 8 month process where you’d emerge out the other side a “financial professional”. You certainly learn a lot but most of us who finished the entire program still feel like we don’t know much, it seemed like an long-winded waste of time, Mgmt seems content with the quality of the reps that exit training and Fidelity certainly seems to overpromise and under-deliver on the onboarding side of things but that’s typical for a large corp. Their goal with training is, in their words “pace over perfection” I can’t imagine touting my reps as remotely competent or being a reputable company when the rep answering the phone doesn’t really know what they’re doing. You should change your objective to: “profits over proficiency”. The job is answering 30-40 calls per day, some good some are bad but it’s definitely more customer service orientated, your most prevalent inbound demographics for this role are the elderly, and rude clueless people that can’t do simple transactions on the website. Pay is bad, 23 an hour start, 24 after that, quarterly target is 800.00 and if you exceed the benchmark, which can be challenging with the callers you get (hour long password resets/account management are fairly common and kill your stats) you can be eligible for year end bonus. 51-54k total comp in a metro area is a tight budget to live on.",5

Opportunities are always given as long as you do your work proficiently. Training was fun and great. Hybrid working from home and office.",Cons,They got rid of profit sharing and free meals.

There are no commissions in this role as many reports indicate - we don't sell anything. Generous quarterly bonuses though, based off phone stats.",Cons,"The 5-days-per-week, one-week-per-month policy is a bit silly. I'd much rather come in 1-2 days per week, every week.

In the rare cases when someone is not treating co workers with respect, or is reported for sexual harassment it is promptly handled. The culture is inclusive to women, people of color, people who are disabled and the LGBTQ community. Great options for career mobility and development. Paid training for people getting licenses. Work life balance is positive for many roles.",Cons,"Pay is low for the work we do and though management can be well meaning, the real decision makers do not care. Raises are only given for good performance if HR decides that it is merited for that year. It’s very ambiguous and leaves many employees feeling sour. Raises are usually only given from promotions, which keeps people trapped in mid tier pay despite hard work and dedication. Resources necessary to answer customer questions are inconsistent, leading to lots of extra work and follow up required. This is another known issue for the call center reps that never gets fixed. Little is done to mitigate abuse from customers. Significant micromanagement due to metrics of being in a call center, while trying to balance extremely complex needs from highly compensated customers.",5

It’s so difficult to move out of a phone role. It’s almost like they’re punishing you for passing the tests instead of rewarding you. I asked numerous times if I could get guidance on moving to other business units and was basically told it’s all about metrics and that there is no alternative. However, even when you meet the ridiculous metrics in a month, it might be that the growth skill you wanted is not even hiring. So it’s like an endless cycle of MAYBE next month, IF you hit the metrics again. I definitely feel like there is a double standard for certain people. The back to back phone calls are exhausting and customers can be so rude. You honestly are just another number to this company.",7

Opportunities for other roles within the company.",Cons,"There is not much career opportunity where you are not on the phone all day. Know this going in. Management can be a stickler on metrics when there are many intangibles on calls. Shift schedule can be very draining with four 10 hour shifts a week. While most clients are generally very nice, regardless taking calls can be exhausting. There is a huge deluge of information which can be very overwhelming when starting.

Good benegits/terrible upper management,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW77585406.htm,2.0,"Jun 21, 2023",Retirement Representative,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,Pros,Good benefits The retirement department is amazing. They know their stuff. Especially retirement help desk,Cons,"They promote based on calls per hour now. They call them ""automatic promotions"". Basically, people prove that they're good at a job by how short their calls are (even if they're providing inaccurate information during that short time). Managers don't even recognize inaccurate information because they're not specialized on a specific function (ex. Retirement, high net worth, stock plan services, etc.) HR does not care about what an employee has gone through with a specific manager. They always take the manager's side, unless the employee makes a bigger deal about it constantly. The system they use to measure ""calls per hour"" is extremely flawed. It glitches people out of their status codes, which causes their CPH to go down. Management is aware of it, but does not take responsibility. They'll tell the employee to directly connect to their router, and that will minimize the disruptions. This is their solution, rather than changing the way CPH is calculated, or simply making CPH an insignificant measurement. Bonuses for the little guys may or may not come. You also might get scammed out of it by some loophole they find. For instance, they had a tax incentive going on that had an ""attendance kicker"" which meant you couldn't have any ""same day PTO""... however, even for people who scheduled PTO months in advance, because some of it landed on a Friday or Monday, the system counted it as ""same day PTO"" , so those people didn't get the ""attendance kicker"" for that month.",4

The benefits are generous despite the 5 year vesting schedule for the 401k. PTO is 23 days plus paid Federal Holidays for anyone under 5 years more for longer tenure. Many of the perks are geared toward a younger workforce so if you have student loans and want to continue your education, you will be served well by Fidelity's benefits.",Cons,Entry level jobs are not a livable wage given the skyrocketing costs of housing and food in the Salt Lake area. It takes many grade levels of promotion to make much more than entry level pay. Luckily the benefits help make up for some of that but some people just need to be able to pay rent and eat as a priority to being fully vested after 5 years of service. Fidelity is growing at a very rapid pace and with all the diversity and inclusion initiatives it's leaving some groups without certain rights. There are no longer safe spaces for women to be able to deal with bodily functions in safety and privacy. The culture is so inclusive and refreshing but over the top which has also created a level of toxicity where some do not dare advocate for themselves without fear of backlash. Hearing the whispers of dissatisfaction over some of this makes for a fairly stressful environment and might be sewing deep seated seeds of division. There has to be a way to dance the diversity and inclusion dance without excluding wide swaths of the population.,1

- 16 week paid training program (8:30am-5:00pm)
- some of the people you meet and community events etc
- good resume builder if you need to help build it
- diversity",Cons,"- Once you are out of the training program you are 12pm-8pm ET. This seems okay at first and if you’re a night owl, but it wears on you. You can advance ur way to a better time slot but if you start a new role that’s the same sort of field, you go back to 12-8pm and have to work your way back up.
- Stats; you have to meet call criteria which some is understandable but then you have situations that they don’t train you on and your stuck ruining your stats. 
- You feel like a robot and are really just a number. Saying the same things over and over to every customer can get tiring especially some of them are super rude and impatient.
- a good manager and a bad one here affects ur motivation to do the same exact thing over and over again

I didn't have a consistent break schedule, and I found it difficult to eat on demand. I don't deal well with toxic people, so it was a very stressful job. I also felt completely drained most days. Since there are so many clients and each have its own rules/policies, it felt like I took a 8-hour test most days. Most of the time I used my breaks to meditate from customers. But if you can handle that. This won't be an issue. My biggest issue was the software time management that tracked every second of your time. I found that really stressful. Not because I wanted to slack, but quite the opposite. I wanted to be perfect on time, and sticking to the schedule that changed every day was very tough. I'm a pretty smart, energetic, and confident person, but this took its toll on me.",1

It’s values are based in the idea of helping people, by empowering everyday people to grow their savings and making investing more accessible. Care for employees is also a major focus and it shows in the benefits and pay practices. Many people stay for a long time because they relate to those values and the people are great as a result. Our CEO (Abigail Johnson) is awesome - she pushes her leaders to be on the cutting edge of research and employee practices, and prioritizes modernizing the company. The company isn’t afraid to invest in hiring and projects at times when other firms are contracting, but is responsible and prudent in running the business. Although there is room to continue improving in DE&I, the priority is clear and actually being lived out. Personal growth and risk taking is rewarded in one’s career, and test-and-learn / agile / scrum methods are common in many areas of the business. I’m extremely proud to work here.",Cons,"Because everyone is so values-driven and the company is growing, it is easy to burn yourself out - there are always opportunities to grow and contribute. Leaders are sensitive to this and it’s starting to change (eg some leaders demonstrate more ability to prioritize or set boundaries), but the onus is still on each employee to manage. The upside is that this is a symptom of the company’s growth and hiring - a much better problem than the alternative. 

The pay is competitive and fair, and regularly assessed, but also structured in a way that is somewhat complex - so some employees leave or decline offers because they don’t understand the long term benefits and pay growth.",2

Don’t get me wrong - there are many really smart marketers within the company who know how and want to do the right things….but are blocked at almost every turn. This comes straight from the executive level - the people running the show clearly don’t get how impactful a funded, motivated, technically advanced marketing team can be.

They invest in cloud technologies like AWS and modern web tools like Angular, Node, etc. They even give you 1 day out of every 10 as a ""Learning Day"" to stay up-to-date or broaden your skills. Pay is competitive, and they gave an ""extra bonus"" last year beyond the normal profit-sharing, just because the company had done so well. Work-life balance is encouraged and respected, and PTO is generous. Most of all, I have no concerns about job security in uncertain times!",Cons,"They are a big company. Working for a small startup might be more exciting and adventurous (though some projects within Fidelity have that ""startup spirit"").

Some folks are driving an hour one-way to sit in an office where no one on their team works which means they drive into an office to still attend meetings on Zoom. Makes no sense!

There are no dummy accounts so you can't practice unless it's on a live account. You really can't move up in a position unless you've been in your current one for 2 years. Our lunches are only 30 mins and granted you get 2 15 min breaks but its hard to unwind mentally on just 30 mins. If a customer writes a bad review on you whether it was the customer's fault it's on you. Also, we were just told in training that if we ask a team for help with a question and they give us the wrong answer and we tell the customer the answer, it's our fault.

Fidelity really cares a lot about their employees and invests a lot into them. Even if the wage is lower than other companies, I think they make up for it with how much they give us benefits-wise. It is also a stable company and rarely lets people go, which is awesome to know that my job is secure. They also hire a lot from within, so there is a lot of room to grow in the organization.",Cons,"It is a massive company and that can result in things taking a really long time to happen. One especially annoying thing is how long it takes to get accesses.

For peak weeks (high call volume weeks) you get a $200 incentive. There’s a $1000 bonus ($700 after taxes) for finishing training and another one after 6 months. There’s about 3 or so weeks of PTO and you can take voluntary unpaid time off too.,Cons,"They require everyone to come on site 5 consecutive days each month when your job can be done better at home. Imagine a room full of phone associates all talking at the same time. Not great for the customer service experience. They love talking about how they support work life balance, but ignore the fact the a lot of employees have to add 2 hours of driving time when going to the office. The 7% 401(k) match doesn’t start until a year after working here and even then you have to wait 3 more years to be vested. A lot of the stats they use to measure call success are not realistic. You can have 90% schedule adherence but if your wrap/idle time is too high (time you use to log calls or use the restroom) then they’ll focus on that. The surveys participants fill out can leave you a positive note, but they’ll label it as “Vague” If a call is transferred and the participant has a bad experience with the second person and fills out a survey, the survey reflects on you because you answered the phone first. Genesis (the system we use for taking calls) has a lot of problems with Mis- transferring calls which causes participants to have a bad experience which makes our jobs harder and our survey scores lower. The technology we use is VERY outdated. We have 2 different systems for doing rollovers/withdrawals. Depending on the type of transaction you’re doing determines which system you use. So it’s inefficient and time consuming.",2

PTO is generous at 160 days per year with increased every 5 years. Culture is fairly relaxed, and work from home is 75%.",Cons,Most of the time they hire people in at entry level and it can be competitive to move up the ranks. Most of the entry level jobs are comparable to a call center with specialized areas of expertise. Some of those roles can be very repetitive so there isn’t a lot of variety of work until you move into other areas of the business.,

Obtained my CEP, which was encouraged and learned an incredible amount. Lots of schedules to choose from, solid bonuses and company stock",Cons,"There were times when managers rotated frequently. During a shift bid, I was one of the top performers who bid for a shift. I didn't receive the shift, when I asked about it and compared my performance to coworkers management said they'd get back to me. They then advised they'd made a mistake, but that they wouldn't correct it. We eventually found a compromise where I worked a different shift, but it was very disconcerting that I was told they'd made a mistake and then I had to push to get them to not simply say ""Too bad"". 

We also had a member of our team who practiced textbook ""Call avoidance"" where they would simply sit there and avoid calls forcing more burden on the team. When confronted, the employee admitted to it, but was given another chance. I knew of other employees who were let go for lesser offenses, so there were inconsistent standards at times. 

At the time I left, I had a new manager of approximately a month, and the senior manager spent the entire interview asking me about that manager and how they worked. I let the manager know that she seemed to have some sort of personal vendetta, she fired him shortly after.",1

It's an indication of how absolutely oblivious upper management is to the situation on the ground. 1. Heavy volume of calls- there is NO pause between calls on many days. It's ridiculous to expect people to provide excellent customer service for an eight or ten hour shift when the volume is that heavy. 2. You will be micro-managed. Even if you're intelligent enough to make decisions that are best for the customer, you'll be told to do it according to the protocol, which a good deal of the time doesn't make any sense. 3. You will feel like a robot. You have to follow Fidelity's robotic call structure; miss any element of that and an excellent call becomes 'satisfactory' according to the judgement of ""Quality,"" the Big Brother of Fidelity who evaluate calls. It is EXTREMELY demoralizing to feel like you have done an amazing job and that customers were happy with your service, but Fidelity is going to find a thousand things to criticize you on. 4. You are expected to know (or know how to locate) massive amounts of information. You will be asked obscure questions, and you'll have to sort through electronic encyclopedias of financial information to attempt to find the answer. 5. Customers get screwed over all the time. Somebody taking a $150 payout from their 401K has to pay the same $25 withdrawal fee as someone who's taking out $100K. Want tracking with your rollover check (Fidelity doesn't do direct rollovers)? You're going to pay $25 for that too. There are ""recordkeeping fees"" on most 401Ks. It's a racket.",6

Fidelity MADE is a SCAM!,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW73415449.htm,1.0,"Feb 7, 2023",Customer Relationship Advocate,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Durham, NC",Pros,"Decent PTO- you are going to need it, you will be burnt-out, I have had jobs with half the amount of PTO and not used all of it, I used every single day at Fidelity Paid Training and Licensing- They pay for your licenses and the time it takes to train for them, many people freak out during licensing and say how difficult it is, I found the time to be pretty good, you have most of the day to yourself to study with the materials they provide and then fill in the gaps with Zoom meetings, pretty different experience from when you get on the phones and are glued to your workstation because you never know when the phone will ring. Overall the exams are hard but I passed on the first attempt for each of them and didn't study a minute when I wasn't getting paid to do so. Having said that if you are having a difficult time with the material it may be a different story for you, also you will lose many co-workers during this time since they cant pass the exams. Our team was lucky and only lost a few but others had close to the whole team fail. If you can't pass the exams they often offer you a job with the 401k team but it is for lower pay and much higher call volume. Managers- Your experience may vary but every manager I had was very helpful and easy to approach Coworkers- Once again your experience may vary but I have had several teams in my time with Fidelity and they were mostly all good to work with Campus- This depends on your regional site but Durham has a very nice campus, with on-site cafeteria, albeit mediocre food, walking trail, very nicely equipped gym, Starbucks and ping pong and cornhole. In Durham's case it has some amenities you might expect from a tech site and that is because much of Fidelity's tech is centered in Durham, I have heard from co-workers in other sites that their campus is not nearly as nice and that probably has to do with the fact that non-tech at Fidelity are treated like second class citizens. Also you know what has many of those amenities, my house, so maybe don't force your coworkers to drive in so they can do the same thing they would have done at home but in an office, where it is louder and harder to hear clients Slow Season -During the summer months call volume slows dramatically and you may only take a handful of calls all day. It's not as great as it sounds though because you sit in ready for over an hour sometimes and you never know when you actually will get a call so you are stuck near your desk and if you have to go to the bathroom or get up for a minute you have go into not ready, do that too much and they are going to say you are avoiding calls and it will affect your metrics. Decent amount of off phone time when it is slow. - Not much to add to this one Benefits- This is the number one reason that anyone works for Fidelity, for the ""amazing"" benefits. While the benefits seem amazing at first, if you dig a little deeper they lose a lot of their luster. For example, the incredible match is only offered after your first full year with the company, in the meantime you get nothing and it takes a full five years to vest. The healthcare is pretty good but you are going to probably need it to go on anxiety medication, other benefits sound good but have pretty limited use, such as adoption assistance, commuter assistance that does not cover gas or vehicle payments but things such as public transportation, I don't know a single co-worker who used the bus to get to work nor if there was even one around and lastly, health reimbursement which sounds great but can only be used for classes and not equipment, so it covers Jazzercise but not weights or a treadmill. One benefit that was really great was student loan payments, which only knock on that was it was limited to 2k a year for up to 5 years. Overall the benefits are still really good, however Fidelity is run by smart people and they crunched the numbers and offering these benefits are cheaper than raising base pay.",Cons,"This first part only applies to those interested in getting into tech, so skip ahead if that is not you. Fidelity offers a non-tech to tech training program called Fidelity MADE, which sounds nice on paper and lures many to the company, however it is poorly run and if you do not check the right diversity boxes, you have no chance. It does not matter if you have a bachelors in computer science from a major state university, previous experience with the technologies they use, if you have had previous technical internships, if you have gotten a 100 on your first attempt on the pre-test, none of it matters because the number one thing they care about is satisfying a diversity requirement. Even the recruiter in charge complained that those running the program made them interview everyone that applied regardless of their qualifications and it set them back heavily. Ultimately it took them three and half months to send out rejection letters, a full month behind their schedule. When you get rejected its just a canned rejection letter that tells you to apply next time and continue practicing your technical skills, which is a joke because the interviews barely touch on anything technical and just a bunch of fluff, tell me about a time questions over and over, I suspect they did this so they could justify hiring blatantly under qualified individuals. This was not just me but several candidates with similar qualifications, the only similarity, our demographic. I wasted a full year before I could apply to MADE, practiced with the technologies in my free time and did everything I could do to prepare but it all was for nothing. If you want to break into tech this is not the way to do it. Future of work - They act like they are geniuses for coming up with the concept of hybrid work. There is no reason to have to go into the office when we worked perfectly fine remotely for over a year, but the billionaire boomer CEO thinks it is a great idea. At first it started as just three days every four weeks but then became five days every four weeks. I suspect they are going to go one week on and one week remote in the future but probably want to wait till after tax season so they can stomach the loss of staff better. The worst part about hybrid work is all the people who are only pay grades 1 or 2 can't generally afford to live near campus, so they have to drive, many well over an hour each way without traffic but all the higher ups do not have a problem with it because they get paid enough to afford decent housing near campus. Pay - The pay is mediocre and below industry standard. It is widely talked about how you can go to any competitor in the industry and make more money but the managers have to remind you how great the benefits are. I went up a pay grade and got to cost of living adjustments during my tenure and I barely noticed a difference. Schedule- Like working 8-5, well too bad because after training you will be moved to shift bid. You will be lucky to get anything before your 5th choice. The shifts start as early as 5am and go as late as 11pm so it is more than likely you will end up working odd hours. Tech Support - Fidelity's internal tech team is almost impossible to reach and it can take up to an hour to reach them, the digital tools that you have can be pretty hit or miss and some of them will just stop working randomly, so it would be great to be able to reach them. Also they are incompetent, when you leave the company make sure to get a receipt for your returned equipment because they will be hounding you to return it even though you already did. Client Obsessed - The company likes to say how client obsessed they are but I found this a joke. Very rarely does anyone at the company actually go above and beyond for the client, they mostly just tell you to let the client know you can't do something. Most of the people at the company are too worried about covering their butt rather than actually doing the right thing. Also it does not matter how great you are with the clients and how great your client survey scores are because how do you get promoted? By having enough calls per hour and if you are even a little under that, you are not getting promoted. You are incentivized to get the client off the phone as quickly as possible and if they don't complain it is good enough. Also I love how they say how client obsessed they are but this is the same company that is actively discouraging the use of mail in favor of digital, the clients who stuck with the company for a half century and helped build it into the billion dollar juggernaut today might not want to use a computer and they should not have to go through a lot of hopes to do so. It really won't even be a problem in about a decade since most of the clients that really care about the mail are in their twilight years. Promotions - The promotions are a joke when it comes to pay, you might get like a 5% bump in pay and a chance to make some more in bonuses. Also for auto promotions they only hire in certain departments randomly so if there is a department you want you will have to keep qualifying for them every single month and hope they are hiring that month and also hope you don't get a trade error because then you are disqualified for that month. Most people just take the first department they are offered rather than going through that. Any off phone openings are crazy competitive, they may have two spots open and get over 60 applicants because most people hate their phone role, so if you want off the phone good luck. Tax Season - During tax season, Feb-April you will be non stop busy and as soon as you hang up the phone another one comes in. I have worked in a restaurant for a long time and I was more physically exhausted after this job during the busy season than an active job like that. After spending all day talking to clients you just want to just sit there and do nothing and not talk to anyone, it is the most emotional and mentally draining time. Anxiety- Almost all your co-workers will talk about how much anxiety they feel all the time. This is not during the first few weeks either, we are talking about people who had been there for well over a year. The Sunday Scaries are real and you will probably get them bad. I ended up having to go on prescription medicine to help manage my anxiety and only got off as soon as I left the job. FINRA regulations - This one is not about Fidelity in particular but about the industry as a whole, FINRA regulations are very strict and require you to give a lot of personal information and limit outside business activities and amount of trading you can do in a quarter. Onboarding - The onboarding process takes forever with Fidelity and is pretty messy. The recruiter told me I had to get drug tested within a couple days but the place they wanted me to use was appointment only and did not have any openings during that time frame. Luckily they were able to reschedule but it was very inconvenient to have to panic that I wasn't going to have a job because I could not get the drug test done in time. Recruiters- Some recruiters straight up lie about the job and what it entails, one of them told my coworker that they mostly would be answering emails. The truth is it is a call center and we are not even able to email clients. How the job is advertised - Fidelity makes a big deal of being a financial professional and how you are going to have a series 7 job. The truth is it is a call center and you are going to feel like you work in retail more than working in finance, especially because you are going to be working retail hours most likely after you are done with training. There is a reason most of the people they hire have no financial background and come from retail jobs. The job itself - All this and I never even mentioned what the actual job is like , the truth is it is torture. One co-worker said it best when he said this job should be banned by the Genova convention, not only did I agree, I used those exact words to describe it to other people before. Surprisingly the clients themselves are not too bad and you even get some pretty pleasant and grateful clients but the job is a grind. Not only is everything you do monitored and recorded, it makes it difficult because you never know when the next call is going to come in. The best way to describe the job is like helping your grandma with her online banking details over the phone all day every day. Many of the people are technologically illiterate and almost everything has to be done on their end digitally. The simplest tasks like password resets and adding banking details can easily take over 40 minutes and wreck your stats. Also if you have to reach out to other departments many times they don't want to take the call from you or it can take a very long time to reach them. I have had to wait over an hour for the fraud department to fix simple issues, obviously the client is mad when you get back and the whole time your stats get destroyed. Many departments like fraud and transition services are chronically understaffed and as soon as you get a call that needs them you know you are not going to have a good time. As the client facing member of the team you are going to have to break a lot of bad news and hear some pretty tough situations. If you like waiting on hold and calling your bank's customer service, this is the job for you. Miscellaneous - The same time they required people to go into the office, they canceled the $10 lunch credit, I don't expect to get free food but the food was only worth it if it was free and I thought it was classless to cancel it at the same time as forcing people into the office more. Also no money for bonuses but a few days later we find out they are going to give a quarter billion dollars to underserved students. They virtue signal about diversity but the tech department is the least diverse place that I have ever seen. Wrap Up - Ask yourself why a company that has such ""great"" benefits, that brags about being voted a top place to work, has to spend so much on recruitment ads. The truth is it is a low paying call center and for every success story you see, there are dozens that washed out.",11

I came in apart of their new LAUNCH program, and the training and support during onboarding was superb!",Cons,"I've always had a gut feeling that things were going to take a turn for the worst after onboarding. It's not terrible, but you're tied to the phones for 8 hours everyday, minus any trainings you're subject to. That is the job we signed up for, but once you're actually doing it full-time, you'll start to hate it. At least I did. You get nice people sometimes, but the participants (people calling in) can be really entitled and annoying. It also seems like everyone is just as confused as you are. They preach about how the F in Fidelity is for flexibility, but it can quickly turn into organized chaos. Most of my training class is still confused about a lot of things when it comes to bonuses, PTO, etc. During training, they'll bring a ton of people in and host panels full of people that preach how awesome Fidelity is. They're not lying per say, but take it with a grain of salt. Go your own path and figure out if it's right for you. The CEO is also trying to make people come in 5 days out of the month (we do 3 currently) starting in January, and they only plan to increase the amount as we go through 2023 and onwards. She's getting a lot of pushback on it because going into the office is draining and a waste of time, since most of us can work more efficiently in our role at home. Salary is a bit on the low end, but they try to make up for it in ""company culture"" and benefits. Most of the benefits I honestly don't use so it would be nice if my salary was higher.",1

So many meetings, all are required to be on-camera. WFH here is so behind the times, they went from mandated 3 days/month during their “dynamic working” to now a full 5-day work week/month, boasting this dynamic model as some sort of super flexible way for their employees to work. Teams are spread across the country and even internationally, why must employees go into an office to take the same Zoom calls with their out of state team and managers? Dynamic working is a farce dressed up in an appealing package as if employees are considered first, when in reality this is a corporation stuck in micromanaging and sinking money into real estate for show when their talent can absolutely perform well and better WFH. What a blow to morale and how convenient this comes out of nowhere with no discussions with managers and after the pulse survey is complete. Onboarding is super overwhelming and stressful, it seems they have a structure with their training but you’re just thrown in with short deadlines and not much direction. CEO is very clearly struggling with adapting to evolving times and letting go of old ways. I could have dealt with some of these, even the original 3 day/month in-office work.

We take calls back to back and follow a strict schedule. If we don’t follow the schedule, then we get yelled at by our managers. I was in a post grad rotation program and our managers basically treat us like kids. It’s pretty cringey and not professional. I felt like I was still in high school going through this program and I don’t really feel much growth. I didn’t go through college just to be stuck in a call center role, getting berated by customers on the daily. I felt like I was lied to during the interview process, because they market this opportunity in such a different way. Just tell us straight up that this is a call center and not waste anyone’s time. Majority of the roles within the company are call center positions, so there’s no way getting off the phones. The one thing I don’t understand about this company, is that the pay is so bad, but people are still so enthusiastic about their job, getting yelled at by customers and being “customer obsessed.”It gives off cultish vibes.

Bad job but difficult to rate.,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW67624620.htm,2.0,"Aug 6, 2022",Customer Relationship Advocate,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Greenwood Village, CO",Pros,"They license you. You will think about this experience in future jobs and feel relief that you no longer work here. This job is probably more attainable than the vast majority of others job in ""finance"".",Cons,"Ultimately the job title is ""Customer Relationship Advocate"", so I can't fault Fidelity for being dishonest in anyway during recruiting. However, if you are a college graduate looking for a job, even if you failed other interviews, do not take this job if you want to enter a job that is A) financial and/or B) analytical.

Firstly, Fidelity will advertise the SIE/S7/S63 as a good way to begin your career and potentially jump to something else later. These licenses are required from a compliance standpoint, that is the only reason they require you to take them. These licenses will not land you a job as an analyst or impress anyone who actually knows what they are. If you are only joining to take these exams, I advise against this.

Close your eyes. Do you want to take phone calls all day every for the foreseeable future, with the only promotions available being other roles where you get a slight pay bump and take phone calls all day? This is your life after finishing licensing, and if you're like me you will be put on a 10-hour shift against your preference. 10 hours all day every day of talking to customers is not going to make you very desirable in any actual finance or analytical job.

This job is 97.5% customer service and 2.5% finance. Some might argue it is not finance at all, the most sophisticated thing you will do on a daily basis is place a stock order for a customer who is too lazy to do it themselves. You will get trainings on concepts that most customers understand through internet articles, or you will be trained on proprietary systems, nothing you can even place on a resume to show you as a desirable candidate for when you will want to leave.

This job is basically an office version of a factory assembly line. The second you finish a call you're onto the next, there is no opportunity to extend to any meaningful project that will help you get out of the perpetual call center. The job is designed to keep you working for them in a call center, they already licensed and trained you so this is most profitable for them. 

The only person I can see who would like this job is someone who worked in call centers in the past and sees this as an upgrade since they can call themselves a licensed broker etc.

For anyone who wishes to have career advancement outside of customer service or potentially their wealth management branch (you will start off a brand new role, continuing to do calls all day every day and maybe after 3-5 years get promoted to a branch), extend your job search and look elsewhere.

Lastly, the reason I put ""difficult to rate"" in the title is because I might seem naive for giving a poor rating to a customer service job since it doesn't offer promotions into analytical or financial jobs. But ultimately I can't give this job a good rating whatsoever because everyday was dreadful; never-ending phone calls with no hope for meaningful advancement.",12

Has a decent corporate culture that encourages a good attitude and free speech.",Cons,"Fidelity lacks technical leadership as a whole and does not value it! They value attitude over all else which means they hire people they like and contract out technical folks. They are not lean and Agile, lots of bloat and middle managers. The environment is extremely political and they accomplish very little. It's extremely hard to get anything done with all bureaucracy, meetings. Lots of non-technical folks blowing hot air and not enough GOOD developers. 90% of their developers are not employees but contractors and turn over is very high. As far as fulltime employees go, Fidelity hires low-level tech folks who have a good attitude but lack experience which further exuberates and compounds not getting things done. Lots of silos and teams that only care about themselves, Cross team communication is probably the poorest I have ever experienced in my career. To add to it all, folks regularly switch teams and so you lose people you trained and you have to start over again. As a whole, in my opinion, it's not a great environment to write and test code in. Everything is always breaking and getting things fixed takes days not hours while your whole team is idle. This encourages idleness and apathy.",5

For me, it's nearly a 50 percent increase over my old job in a different industry. That's not a raise, that's life changing. There are also opportunities for bonuses.

It's totally okay if we'd rather go ahead and work onsite every day, too.",Cons,"Inconsistent support - my onboarding coach didn't work in my role. They clearly want me to do well and can coach on if I am hitting certain points when interacting with customers, but they have pointedly stated that I'm ""supposed to be the expert"" in my role. When I reach out to my team for help while assisting customers, I only get answers to the questions that aren't part of our specific role. However, I'm not going to be trained in that specific role until at least 4-5 months on the job. I'm willing to stumble blindly through an adventure of learning alongside our customers, but many of them don't have time for that, and me not knowing what I'm doing yet is leading to a poor customer experience for them. The headsets provided for working from home aren't compatible with the onsite phones, so that was an unexpected learning curve. My coach strangely seemed perplexed that I didn't know how to operate the call center equipment already on the first day of calls despite never having seen or used that equipment before. It is extremely difficult for clients to hear me clearly, and often vice versa, due to the background conversations when working onsite. Being able to hear clearly is the top reason I'd like to continue working at home. Some of our customers are intentionally cruel. There are rude customers everywhere, but I've never cried during work every day before.",
