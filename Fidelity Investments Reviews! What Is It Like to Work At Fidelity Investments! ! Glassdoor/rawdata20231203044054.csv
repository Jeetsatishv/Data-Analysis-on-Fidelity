The breadth of this company provides a great opportunity to try out different career paths or boost your current one.,Cons,"In my current role, I am working overtime more often than I'd like with recognition that seems to only go so far until it sizzles out. That may be tied to the size of the company itself, where promotions work in a ""trickle down"" manner.",226

Or so I'm told honestly I don't understand why we don't have a single payer system it's insane that to have health care you need a stable job.  Don't even get me started on dental... What are they?  Luxury bones?,Cons,"Despite the fact that the average employee of this company can't even power on a computer my role is the lowest paid in the company.

To be clear the folks who work from home taking chats/calls who escalate their tickets to my team make more than my team. 

Let's talk numbers.

Inflation in 2021 was around 9% but the average raise for my team was 2%.

2022 was again around 9... But we got a whopping 7%.

That's a pay cut baby.  When we spoke to our leadership they literally told us to go find another job.

What's more is there is no out. You are trapped in this role forever or until you find something better elsewhere.  They offer programs to ""help you progress."" but then banish the techs because they don't want tech people. 

They also abuse the ever living crap out of contractors.  They want you as an employee handling people with millions of dollars in trades laptops but they don't wanna give health care.  Incredible.",3
Ehh...,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW82004455.htm,2.0,"Nov 21, 2023",Financial Customer Associate,Current Employee,"Durham, NC",Pros,The starting pay is pretty good for a call center. Great benefits as well.,Cons,"They claim that there are so many different opportunities to grow within the company, but make it impossible to explore those options due to working a strict schedule on the phones. The call volume is back to back with no room to breathe in between calls. You go through 3 months of training and still feel confused at the end. They encourage you to ask questions and reach out for help, but when you reach out for help, you're reprimanded for doing so. You have no say so in your schedule and you have to work between 12pm-8pm so say goodbye to having any type of social life. They offer free therapy and after working there for about a week, you'll quickly understand why.",3
Let Go While 7 Months Pregnant,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW80985681.htm,1.0,"Oct 16, 2023",Financial Consultant I,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Chicago, IL",Pros,I was drawn to the training program for the Financial Consultant role. Good 401k match.,Cons,"I was in a 1 year training program for the Financial Consultant role while completing my CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ certification. I was told I needed to sell more insurance, annuities, and managed accounts in order to continue on as a Financial Consultant. I was let go as soon as I hit the 1 year mark, shortly after I became a CFP® professional. I had told HR that I was pregnant when I became concerned about losing my job and asked to be considered for a different role within Fidelity (since I knew I would not be able to interview and start another job at 7 months pregnant). After I was let go by my manager, I reached back out to HR and they were not even aware that my employment was being terminated. Everyone I dealt with at Fidelity was extremely insensitive to the fact that this would cause a huge amount of stress to me and my family at a time that stress had serious potential health risks to myself and my baby. I ended up being unemployed for close to 9 months. I was interviewing for new jobs while also taking care of a newborn and paying extremely high premiums for health insurance for my family. Only 23% of CFP professionals are women, and only about 15% of financial advisors are women. Even though Fidelity touts its family values and culture, I would not recommend Fidelity to women based on my experience.",18

The onboarding managers openly compare you to others, bring up personal things in 1 on 1s about other associates and make comments about your life like suggesting you should be married or have children by now. They yell at you on the floor in front of the entire facility if you do something they don't like. The don't advocate for people who have disabilities when it comes to learning the material so you're constantly compared to others openly. They require you to work multiple hours a week UNPAID after your schedule and on weekends. They SUGGEST you should work through your breaks and lunches.",2

These can be challenging to balance at times, but they do their best and are mostly successful at it. Flexible work schedules is primary reason Fidelity is retaining a lot of their talent. It's for these reasons I've been with the company almost 20 years and plan to retire here if possible.",Cons,"Lately the company has been getting a little political and pushing some activist type initiatives, which doesn't sit well with many employees. They of course won't speak up and say much, especially ones who've been around a while. The company needs to stick to financial matters and stay away from woke agendas or they may face backlash even if their intentions are sound.",2

Their 401k match and profit sharing is impressive. Great starting place for a career. Career mobility is available yet there can be ceilings for advancement. Their products and platform solutions are also quite good. Truly a client centric organization and is focused on maintaining that perception. Their approach during Covid was pretty level-headed.,Cons,"Consistent theme where senior mgmt proved to be disinterested and detached from the happenings on the ground. In retrospect, there is also an unhealthy fear within the workforce. There was always a worry about a rumored layoff and then those that always make a point to ‘appear busy.’ Often you will hear from peers or managers that the grass isn’t always greener or that you should think twice before leaving. Other comments regarding excessive workload expectations and having a stressful work environment are also understated. That is pretty consistent across the channels.",3

They also have a ""Fidelity Made"" program for people interested in tech.",Cons,"Upper leadership doesn't listen to employees.

Gone is the autonomy and flexibility as ""Big Brother"" started watching your every badge swipe. Go ahead take PTO during a Connect Week, but be prepared to have to make those days up in the office. The required in-office attendance wasn't really helping with collaboration, associates kept earbuds in and to themselves anyway and still attended all meetings virtually.

Lots of monitoring of our movement (92% has to be at the desk of your day) and very little time to learn or move up. Managers on a whole are good people but have no power to help.

CRA role: read this first!,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW80500091.htm,4.0,"Sep 28, 2023",Customer Relationship Advocate,Former Employee,"Merrimack, NH",Pros,"1.) About 20 PTO days, benefits, lots of perks like a concierge you can call to help with anything. 2.) My managers were very good at communicating and looking out for my mental health. I was going through licensing for a call center role and was getting a little burnt out. One of my managers even had a real talk with me about how hard the role was and supported my decision to leave the company. The managers are the real gems.",Cons,"1.) Fidelity requires associates to be in one week every month. Though it was nice to work from home most of the time, the in office week was required and NOT flexible. Sometimes I had to use my PTO days because I was sick and couldn't make it to the office. I would rather be in the office any 5 days of my choosing. 2.) Licensing is hard. Many people left because they couldn't pass the tests (including me). I was in training long enough to see what my role looked like after licensing and it only gets harder. 2.) If you're in the CRA role, please read this first. Do you really want to stay in a job where it's just one call after the other, no idea what it's going to be about, no idea if the client is going to scream at you, and thrown into it without any real training? Fidelity training is very long but does not go over every scenario there is; they expect you to know 100 things while doing something as simple as phone calls. Most of them were password resets or transfers to branches and while most clients were very pleasant, there were some that were outright abusive. I don't blame them as it's managing their money but some could ruin your day. I would not doubt it if my role was completely taken over by AI in a few years. Licensing was fine but once you get to the job it is very overwhelming and exhausting. I knew some coworkers who said that it was very stressful learning so much while also not knowing everything. There just isn't enough time fit everything in your schedule. This was what my day was like when taking calls for two weeks: - 8am: 30 minute team meeting (sometimes this was at 4:30 depending on schedule) - 8:30am: start calls for the day - 10:30am: take 15 min break - 12pm: break for lunch - 1pm: start calls again - 3:30pm: take 30 minute break - 5pm: end day I could take a 45 min break which is measured to the minute while lunch after training is only a half hour. Your whole day will just be phone calls. On my worst day I took about 40 but I've known people who took 60. Even just two days on the phones burnt me out so much.",7

This is strictly a sales role and very minimally a planning role. I think if upper management knew how investor centers were being run and how churning clients and quick selling was being pushed they would be disturbed. Clients usually sell out of managed money within 5 years bc they were falsely sold, they’ve had advisor turnover once or twice in that timeframe, and managed accounts underperform their own asset manager funds.

As a team leader it felt like there were still 17 levels of people above me communicating decisions, and there was a real disconnect between the front-line and the very top on what was needed and wanted. Pay was decent, but HR makes it about impossible to negotiate numbers or get pay bumps off-cycle.

I worked 4x10 M, W, F, Sa from 12:30 - 11pm.

The expectation for hourly roles is: you clock in on the dot and punch out on the dot without pressure to work extra. They respect your boundaries in this way which is appreciated. The way licensing was structured was nice, you study 90% of the week then come in for a half a day of phones to keep those skills somewhat ready for when you pass. Overall if you’re a recent college grad or looking to make a career transition from another industry this isn’t a bad place to be, you’ll likely get an offer because they have a lot of seats to fill and a decent amount of turnover at the 1-2 year mark.",Cons,"I have worked in other industries and other large corporations before coming to Fidelity, if you’re new to the workforce or new to working for a decent large corp this experience may seem amazing but it’s mostly external and internal marketing driving that narrative. Most of the 5 star reviews for this role specifically must be from somewhat naive folks or folks that can’t see through the “lifestyle” aspects of the culture and can’t see it for what it really is. The recruiter described the training program as “world class” explaining it would be this 8 month process where you’d emerge out the other side a “financial professional”. You certainly learn a lot but most of us who finished the entire program still feel like we don’t know much, it seemed like an long-winded waste of time, Mgmt seems content with the quality of the reps that exit training and Fidelity certainly seems to overpromise and under-deliver on the onboarding side of things but that’s typical for a large corp. Their goal with training is, in their words “pace over perfection” I can’t imagine touting my reps as remotely competent or being a reputable company when the rep answering the phone doesn’t really know what they’re doing. You should change your objective to: “profits over proficiency”. The job is answering 30-40 calls per day, some good some are bad but it’s definitely more customer service orientated, your most prevalent inbound demographics for this role are the elderly, and rude clueless people that can’t do simple transactions on the website. Pay is bad, 23 an hour start, 24 after that, quarterly target is 800.00 and if you exceed the benchmark, which can be challenging with the callers you get (hour long password resets/account management are fairly common and kill your stats) you can be eligible for year end bonus. 51-54k total comp in a metro area is a tight budget to live on.",5

The communication. The job description and entails do not match up. Bullying and abuse of power. Demand does not equal appropriate pay. You have an obscene workload. Calls are timed and scored. In training it was a lot of making fun of people for incorrect answers. You do an invasive and demanding background check for a pay and benefits you can get at basic companies. Diversity is next to none but in my class there where 3 people outside of white 2 of them where already with the company and was switch departments. I would I have recommended this for someone just starting their career but the intense background, drug screening you have to fill 3 cups up. Demand and low pay is not worth it.

Raises are only given for good performance if HR decides that it is merited for that year. It’s very ambiguous and leaves many employees feeling sour. Raises are usually only given from promotions, which keeps people trapped in mid tier pay despite hard work and dedication.

I asked numerous times if I could get guidance on moving to other business units and was basically told it’s all about metrics and that there is no alternative. However, even when you meet the ridiculous metrics in a month, it might be that the growth skill you wanted is not even hiring. So it’s like an endless cycle of MAYBE next month, IF you hit the metrics again. I definitely feel like there is a double standard for certain people.

They know their stuff. Especially retirement help desk,Cons,"They promote based on calls per hour now. They call them ""automatic promotions"". Basically, people prove that they're good at a job by how short their calls are (even if they're providing inaccurate information during that short time). Managers don't even recognize inaccurate information because they're not specialized on a specific function (ex. Retirement, high net worth, stock plan services, etc.) HR does not care about what an employee has gone through with a specific manager. They always take the manager's side, unless the employee makes a bigger deal about it constantly. The system they use to measure ""calls per hour"" is extremely flawed. It glitches people out of their status codes, which causes their CPH to go down. Management is aware of it, but does not take responsibility. They'll tell the employee to directly connect to their router, and that will minimize the disruptions. This is their solution, rather than changing the way CPH is calculated, or simply making CPH an insignificant measurement. Bonuses for the little guys may or may not come. You also might get scammed out of it by some loophole they find. For instance, they had a tax incentive going on that had an ""attendance kicker"" which meant you couldn't have any ""same day PTO""... however, even for people who scheduled PTO months in advance, because some of it landed on a Friday or Monday, the system counted it as ""same day PTO"" , so those people didn't get the ""attendance kicker"" for that month.",4

Many of the perks are geared toward a younger workforce so if you have student loans and want to continue your education, you will be served well by Fidelity's benefits.",Cons,Entry level jobs are not a livable wage given the skyrocketing costs of housing and food in the Salt Lake area. It takes many grade levels of promotion to make much more than entry level pay. Luckily the benefits help make up for some of that but some people just need to be able to pay rent and eat as a priority to being fully vested after 5 years of service. Fidelity is growing at a very rapid pace and with all the diversity and inclusion initiatives it's leaving some groups without certain rights. There are no longer safe spaces for women to be able to deal with bodily functions in safety and privacy. The culture is so inclusive and refreshing but over the top which has also created a level of toxicity where some do not dare advocate for themselves without fear of backlash. Hearing the whispers of dissatisfaction over some of this makes for a fairly stressful environment and might be sewing deep seated seeds of division. There has to be a way to dance the diversity and inclusion dance without excluding wide swaths of the population.,1

As a recruiter- I can do my work remotely and it's been inconvenient driving to the office which means less productivity time to do my work. There shouldn't a strict schedule to follow.

You often work alongside midlevel managers to executives at every level and you are appreciated for your contributions no matter what level of tenure or seniority you have.

It goes without saying that you get out what you put in, so you likely won't experience the following cons as long as you are actively growing/learning new skills and networking/volunteering with groups for new opportunities.

-Base pay can be a little low, especially in your first couple years if you're not actively seeking new opportunities to learn new skills, network, or take on side projects. 
-Annual pay increases are small for a profitable company. To realize a significant jump in pay, you need to actively seek a promotion or jump laterally to another team or business unit.

Then ""dynamic"" working started, where they forced employees to come to the office for 3 days a month, in the same week that they scheduled. Then a day or two after they closed the employee satisfaction survey, they announced that they were increasing that significantly starting in January. Suspicious timing to say the least. Why the need to go to the office? Remote working increased employee productivity. There is no need for all positions to be in the office. Yes, they have an exception process, but those approvals are far and few between, and do not cover all employee issues.

- Stats; you have to meet call criteria which some is understandable but then you have situations that they don’t train you on and your stuck ruining your stats.

Since there are so many clients and each have its own rules/policies, it felt like I took a 8-hour test most days. Most of the time I used my breaks to meditate from customers. But if you can handle that. This won't be an issue. My biggest issue was the software time management that tracked every second of your time. I found that really stressful.

Care for employees is also a major focus and it shows in the benefits and pay practices. Many people stay for a long time because they relate to those values and the people are great as a result. Our CEO (Abigail Johnson) is awesome - she pushes her leaders to be on the cutting edge of research and employee practices, and prioritizes modernizing the company. The company isn’t afraid to invest in hiring and projects at times when other firms are contracting, but is responsible and prudent in running the business. Although there is room to continue improving in DE&I, the priority is clear and actually being lived out.

One could only imagine how distraught I was to learn that I had lost it all because of the exam. I gave my all every single day and showed up on site despite the three day per month minimum requirement. I feel as though I tried and succeeded, to the best of my ability, to make a positive mark on the faces I saw at the workplace and put my best foot forward at this transitionary time in my personal life as well. This opportunity was a way out of a lot of troubling situations for me. I write this review, hence, to highlight the important truth and current state of mind I possess with respect to my former employer, for whom I have zero resentment or reason to ever say anything negative about Fidelity whatsoever. It was the greatest opportunity in the near dozen jobs I have listed on my resume, and kickstarted a career in the securities industry by inspiring me to re-register for the FINRA exams all by myself again. To everyone that gave me an opportunity at this incredible firm I say thank you, and with the experience I've gained and things I've learned, I will not still be at this company by the time I retire, but somewhere beyond the stars instead, as this setback has given me an opportunity - just like Fidelity did - to dream big in my career with a vow for hard work. #Fidelityassociate",Cons,"Like I said, no cons at all!",1

The clients really love this company, too.",Cons,"Meritocracy based promotions at the lower end, then relationship and perceived experienced based at the upper level positions. You need people to know you, and you need to know people if you want higher positions. Have to come into the office more now, thanks to regulators.

Most marketing teams here are treated like red headed step children, lacking tools & resources to achieve the most basic marketing objectives. It’s like stepping back into 1999. Don’t get me wrong - there are many really smart marketers within the company who know how and want to do the right things….but are blocked at almost every turn. This comes straight from the executive level - the people running the show clearly don’t get how impactful a funded, motivated, technically advanced marketing team can be. Especially interesting given the company is very intent on engaging the next-gen to fill their long term pipeline - not sure how they think they are going to get them without smart, data-driven marketing programs and the technology that supports.",4

They invest in cloud technologies like AWS and modern web tools like Angular, Node, etc. They even give you 1 day out of every 10 as a ""Learning Day"" to stay up-to-date or broaden your skills. Pay is competitive, and they gave an ""extra bonus"" last year beyond the normal profit-sharing, just because the company had done so well. Work-life balance is encouraged and respected, and PTO is generous. Most of all, I have no concerns about job security in uncertain times!",Cons,"They are a big company. Working for a small startup might be more exciting and adventurous (though some projects within Fidelity have that ""startup spirit""). There's some inertia and levels of bureaucracy if you want to change a process or procedure. The huge size of the company means that you can have a totally different experience on a different project or division of the company.",

I was told that everything needs to be perfect. The job that they advertised was nothing compared to what you have to deal with. Training is 11 weeks long and you read and watch videos. There are no dummy accounts so you can't practice unless it's on a live account. You really can't move up in a position unless you've been in your current one for 2 years. Our lunches are only 30 mins and granted you get 2 15 min breaks but its hard to unwind mentally on just 30 mins. If a customer writes a bad review on you whether it was the customer's fault it's on you. Also, we were just told in training that if we ask a team for help with a question and they give us the wrong answer and we tell the customer the answer, it's our fault.

Some folks are driving an hour one-way to sit in an office where no one on their team works which means they drive into an office to still attend meetings on Zoom. Makes no sense!

For peak weeks (high call volume weeks) you get a $200 incentive. There’s a $1000 bonus ($700 after taxes) for finishing training and another one after 6 months. There’s about 3 or so weeks of PTO and you can take voluntary unpaid time off too.,Cons,"They require everyone to come on site 5 consecutive days each month when your job can be done better at home. Imagine a room full of phone associates all talking at the same time. Not great for the customer service experience. They love talking about how they support work life balance, but ignore the fact the a lot of employees have to add 2 hours of driving time when going to the office. The 7% 401(k) match doesn’t start until a year after working here and even then you have to wait 3 more years to be vested. A lot of the stats they use to measure call success are not realistic. You can have 90% schedule adherence but if your wrap/idle time is too high (time you use to log calls or use the restroom) then they’ll focus on that. The surveys participants fill out can leave you a positive note, but they’ll label it as “Vague” If a call is transferred and the participant has a bad experience with the second person and fills out a survey, the survey reflects on you because you answered the phone first. Genesis (the system we use for taking calls) has a lot of problems with Mis- transferring calls which causes participants to have a bad experience which makes our jobs harder and our survey scores lower. The technology we use is VERY outdated. We have 2 different systems for doing rollovers/withdrawals. Depending on the type of transaction you’re doing determines which system you use.

Obtained my CEP, which was encouraged and learned an incredible amount. Lots of schedules to choose from, solid bonuses and company stock",Cons,"There were times when managers rotated frequently. During a shift bid, I was one of the top performers who bid for a shift. I didn't receive the shift, when I asked about it and compared my performance to coworkers management said they'd get back to me. They then advised they'd made a mistake, but that they wouldn't correct it. We eventually found a compromise where I worked a different shift, but it was very disconcerting that I was told they'd made a mistake and then I had to push to get them to not simply say ""Too bad"". 

We also had a member of our team who practiced textbook ""Call avoidance"" where they would simply sit there and avoid calls forcing more burden on the team. When confronted, the employee admitted to it, but was given another chance. I knew of other employees who were let go for lesser offenses, so there were inconsistent standards at times. 

At the time I left, I had a new manager of approximately a month, and the senior manager spent the entire interview asking me about that manager and how they worked. I let the manager know that she seemed to have some sort of personal vendetta, she fired him shortly after.",1

It's an indication of how absolutely oblivious upper management is to the situation on the ground. 1. Heavy volume of calls- there is NO pause between calls on many days. It's ridiculous to expect people to provide excellent customer service for an eight or ten hour shift when the volume is that heavy. 2. You will be micro-managed. Even if you're intelligent enough to make decisions that are best for the customer, you'll be told to do it according to the protocol, which a good deal of the time doesn't make any sense. 3. You will feel like a robot. You have to follow Fidelity's robotic call structure; miss any element of that and an excellent call becomes 'satisfactory' according to the judgement of ""Quality,"" the Big Brother of Fidelity who evaluate calls. It is EXTREMELY demoralizing to feel like you have done an amazing job and that customers were happy with your service, but Fidelity is going to find a thousand things to criticize you on. 4. You are expected to know (or know how to locate) massive amounts of information. You will be asked obscure questions, and you'll have to sort through electronic encyclopedias of financial information to attempt to find the answer. 5. Customers get screwed over all the time. Somebody taking a $150 payout from their 401K has to pay the same $25 withdrawal fee as someone who's taking out $100K. Want tracking with your rollover check (Fidelity doesn't do direct rollovers)? You're going to pay $25 for that too. There are ""recordkeeping fees"" on most 401Ks. It's a racket.",6

Fidelity MADE is a SCAM!,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW73415449.htm,1.0,"Feb 7, 2023",Customer Relationship Advocate,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Durham, NC",Pros,"Decent PTO- you are going to need it, you will be burnt-out, I have had jobs with half the amount of PTO and not used all of it, I used every single day at Fidelity Paid Training and Licensing- They pay for your licenses and the time it takes to train for them, many people freak out during licensing and say how difficult it is, I found the time to be pretty good, you have most of the day to yourself to study with the materials they provide and then fill in the gaps with Zoom meetings, pretty different experience from when you get on the phones and are glued to your workstation because you never know when the phone will ring. Overall the exams are hard but I passed on the first attempt for each of them and didn't study a minute when I wasn't getting paid to do so. Having said that if you are having a difficult time with the material it may be a different story for you, also you will lose many co-workers during this time since they cant pass the exams. Our team was lucky and only lost a few but others had close to the whole team fail. If you can't pass the exams they often offer you a job with the 401k team but it is for lower pay and much higher call volume. Managers- Your experience may vary but every manager I had was very helpful and easy to approach Coworkers- Once again your experience may vary but I have had several teams in my time with Fidelity and they were mostly all good to work with Campus- This depends on your regional site but Durham has a very nice campus, with on-site cafeteria, albeit mediocre food, walking trail, very nicely equipped gym, Starbucks and ping pong and cornhole. In Durham's case it has some amenities you might expect from a tech site and that is because much of Fidelity's tech is centered in Durham, I have heard from co-workers in other sites that their campus is not nearly as nice and that probably has to do with the fact that non-tech at Fidelity are treated like second class citizens. Also you know what has many of those amenities, my house, so maybe don't force your coworkers to drive in so they can do the same thing they would have done at home but in an office, where it is louder and harder to hear clients Slow Season -During the summer months call volume slows dramatically and you may only take a handful of calls all day. It's not as great as it sounds though because you sit in ready for over an hour sometimes and you never know when you actually will get a call so you are stuck near your desk and if you have to go to the bathroom or get up for a minute you have go into not ready, do that too much and they are going to say you are avoiding calls and it will affect your metrics. Decent amount of off phone time when it is slow. - Not much to add to this one Benefits- This is the number one reason that anyone works for Fidelity, for the ""amazing"" benefits. While the benefits seem amazing at first, if you dig a little deeper they lose a lot of their luster. For example, the incredible match is only offered after your first full year with the company, in the meantime you get nothing and it takes a full five years to vest. The healthcare is pretty good but you are going to probably need it to go on anxiety medication, other benefits sound good but have pretty limited use, such as adoption assistance, commuter assistance that does not cover gas or vehicle payments but things such as public transportation, I don't know a single co-worker who used the bus to get to work nor if there was even one around and lastly, health reimbursement which sounds great but can only be used for classes and not equipment, so it covers Jazzercise but not weights or a treadmill. One benefit that was really great was student loan payments, which only knock on that was it was limited to 2k a year for up to 5 years. Overall the benefits are still really good, however Fidelity is run by smart people and they crunched the numbers and offering these benefits are cheaper than raising base pay.",Cons,"This first part only applies to those interested in getting into tech, so skip ahead if that is not you. Fidelity offers a non-tech to tech training program called Fidelity MADE, which sounds nice on paper and lures many to the company, however it is poorly run and if you do not check the right diversity boxes, you have no chance. It does not matter if you have a bachelors in computer science from a major state university, previous experience with the technologies they use, if you have had previous technical internships, if you have gotten a 100 on your first attempt on the pre-test, none of it matters because the number one thing they care about is satisfying a diversity requirement. Even the recruiter in charge complained that those running the program made them interview everyone that applied regardless of their qualifications and it set them back heavily. Ultimately it took them three and half months to send out rejection letters, a full month behind their schedule. When you get rejected its just a canned rejection letter that tells you to apply next time and continue practicing your technical skills, which is a joke because the interviews barely touch on anything technical and just a bunch of fluff, tell me about a time questions over and over, I suspect they did this so they could justify hiring blatantly under qualified individuals. This was not just me but several candidates with similar qualifications, the only similarity, our demographic. I wasted a full year before I could apply to MADE, practiced with the technologies in my free time and did everything I could do to prepare but it all was for nothing. If you want to break into tech this is not the way to do it. Future of work - They act like they are geniuses for coming up with the concept of hybrid work. There is no reason to have to go into the office when we worked perfectly fine remotely for over a year, but the billionaire boomer CEO thinks it is a great idea. At first it started as just three days every four weeks but then became five days every four weeks. I suspect they are going to go one week on and one week remote in the future but probably want to wait till after tax season so they can stomach the loss of staff better. The worst part about hybrid work is all the people who are only pay grades 1 or 2 can't generally afford to live near campus, so they have to drive, many well over an hour each way without traffic but all the higher ups do not have a problem with it because they get paid enough to afford decent housing near campus. Pay - The pay is mediocre and below industry standard. It is widely talked about how you can go to any competitor in the industry and make more money but the managers have to remind you how great the benefits are. I went up a pay grade and got to cost of living adjustments during my tenure and I barely noticed a difference. Schedule- Like working 8-5, well too bad because after training you will be moved to shift bid. You will be lucky to get anything before your 5th choice. The shifts start as early as 5am and go as late as 11pm so it is more than likely you will end up working odd hours. Tech Support - Fidelity's internal tech team is almost impossible to reach and it can take up to an hour to reach them, the digital tools that you have can be pretty hit or miss and some of them will just stop working randomly, so it would be great to be able to reach them. Also they are incompetent, when you leave the company make sure to get a receipt for your returned equipment because they will be hounding you to return it even though you already did. Client Obsessed - The company likes to say how client obsessed they are but I found this a joke. Very rarely does anyone at the company actually go above and beyond for the client, they mostly just tell you to let the client know you can't do something. Most of the people at the company are too worried about covering their butt rather than actually doing the right thing. Also it does not matter how great you are with the clients and how great your client survey scores are because how do you get promoted? By having enough calls per hour and if you are even a little under that, you are not getting promoted. You are incentivized to get the client off the phone as quickly as possible and if they don't complain it is good enough. Also I love how they say how client obsessed they are but this is the same company that is actively discouraging the use of mail in favor of digital, the clients who stuck with the company for a half century and helped build it into the billion dollar juggernaut today might not want to use a computer and they should not have to go through a lot of hopes to do so. It really won't even be a problem in about a decade since most of the clients that really care about the mail are in their twilight years. Promotions - The promotions are a joke when it comes to pay, you might get like a 5% bump in pay and a chance to make some more in bonuses. Also for auto promotions they only hire in certain departments randomly so if there is a department you want you will have to keep qualifying for them every single month and hope they are hiring that month and also hope you don't get a trade error because then you are disqualified for that month. Most people just take the first department they are offered rather than going through that. Any off phone openings are crazy competitive, they may have two spots open and get over 60 applicants because most people hate their phone role, so if you want off the phone good luck. Tax Season - During tax season, Feb-April you will be non stop busy and as soon as you hang up the phone another one comes in. I have worked in a restaurant for a long time and I was more physically exhausted after this job during the busy season than an active job like that. After spending all day talking to clients you just want to just sit there and do nothing and not talk to anyone, it is the most emotional and mentally draining time. Anxiety- Almost all your co-workers will talk about how much anxiety they feel all the time. This is not during the first few weeks either, we are talking about people who had been there for well over a year. The Sunday Scaries are real and you will probably get them bad. I ended up having to go on prescription medicine to help manage my anxiety and only got off as soon as I left the job. FINRA regulations - This one is not about Fidelity in particular but about the industry as a whole, FINRA regulations are very strict and require you to give a lot of personal information and limit outside business activities and amount of trading you can do in a quarter. Onboarding - The onboarding process takes forever with Fidelity and is pretty messy. The recruiter told me I had to get drug tested within a couple days but the place they wanted me to use was appointment only and did not have any openings during that time frame. Luckily they were able to reschedule but it was very inconvenient to have to panic that I wasn't going to have a job because I could not get the drug test done in time. Recruiters- Some recruiters straight up lie about the job and what it entails, one of them told my coworker that they mostly would be answering emails. The truth is it is a call center and we are not even able to email clients. How the job is advertised - Fidelity makes a big deal of being a financial professional and how you are going to have a series 7 job. The truth is it is a call center and you are going to feel like you work in retail more than working in finance, especially because you are going to be working retail hours most likely after you are done with training. There is a reason most of the people they hire have no financial background and come from retail jobs. The job itself - All this and I never even mentioned what the actual job is like , the truth is it is torture. One co-worker said it best when he said this job should be banned by the Genova convention, not only did I agree, I used those exact words to describe it to other people before. Surprisingly the clients themselves are not too bad and you even get some pretty pleasant and grateful clients but the job is a grind. Not only is everything you do monitored and recorded, it makes it difficult because you never know when the next call is going to come in. The best way to describe the job is like helping your grandma with her online banking details over the phone all day every day. Many of the people are technologically illiterate and almost everything has to be done on their end digitally. The simplest tasks like password resets and adding banking details can easily take over 40 minutes and wreck your stats. Also if you have to reach out to other departments many times they don't want to take the call from you or it can take a very long time to reach them. I have had to wait over an hour for the fraud department to fix simple issues, obviously the client is mad when you get back and the whole time your stats get destroyed. Many departments like fraud and transition services are chronically understaffed and as soon as you get a call that needs them you know you are not going to have a good time. As the client facing member of the team you are going to have to break a lot of bad news and hear some pretty tough situations. If you like waiting on hold and calling your bank's customer service, this is the job for you. Miscellaneous - The same time they required people to go into the office, they canceled the $10 lunch credit, I don't expect to get free food but the food was only worth it if it was free and I thought it was classless to cancel it at the same time as forcing people into the office more. Also no money for bonuses but a few days later we find out they are going to give a quarter billion dollars to underserved students. They virtue signal about diversity but the tech department is the least diverse place that I have ever seen. Wrap Up - Ask yourself why a company that has such ""great"" benefits, that brags about being voted a top place to work, has to spend so much on recruitment ads. The truth is it is a low paying call center and for every success story you see, there are dozens that washed out.",11

It's not terrible, but you're tied to the phones for 8 hours everyday, minus any trainings you're subject to. That is the job we signed up for, but once you're actually doing it full-time, you'll start to hate it. At least I did. You get nice people sometimes, but the participants (people calling in) can be really entitled and annoying. It also seems like everyone is just as confused as you are. They preach about how the F in Fidelity is for flexibility, but it can quickly turn into organized chaos. Most of my training class is still confused about a lot of things when it comes to bonuses, PTO, etc. During training, they'll bring a ton of people in and host panels full of people that preach how awesome Fidelity is. They're not lying per say, but take it with a grain of salt. Go your own path and figure out if it's right for you. The CEO is also trying to make people come in 5 days out of the month (we do 3 currently) starting in January, and they only plan to increase the amount as we go through 2023 and onwards. She's getting a lot of pushback on it because going into the office is draining and a waste of time, since most of us can work more efficiently in our role at home.

Feeling regret after taking this new job. You have to essentially sell your soul to work here, you have to hand over all your financial accounts and there are so many restrictions and requirements with what you can do from your accounts down to outside activity, to social media, and even access to your personal devices if you choose to use your personal phone for work. So many meetings, all are required to be on-camera. WFH here is so behind the times, they went from mandated 3 days/month during their “dynamic working” to now a full 5-day work week/month, boasting this dynamic model as some sort of super flexible way for their employees to work. Teams are spread across the country and even internationally, why must employees go into an office to take the same Zoom calls with their out of state team and managers? Dynamic working is a farce dressed up in an appealing package as if employees are considered first, when in reality this is a corporation stuck in micromanaging and sinking money into real estate for show when their talent can absolutely perform well and better WFH. What a blow to morale and how convenient this comes out of nowhere with no discussions with managers and after the pulse survey is complete. Onboarding is super overwhelming and stressful, it seems they have a structure with their training but you’re just thrown in with short deadlines and not much direction. CEO is very clearly struggling with adapting to evolving times and letting go of old ways. I could have dealt with some of these, even the original 3 day/month in-office work.

they calculate more stats than you can even think of. these stats will be thrown at you daily and you will be asked to explain every bit if its out of the desired window. bonuses and pay increases depend on that.

They have good benefits 401k and profit share. They have everything at the company that you can think of as far a technology, so lots to learn for entry level people. Has a decent corporate culture that encourages a good attitude and free speech.",Cons,"Fidelity lacks technical leadership as a whole and does not value it! They value attitude over all else which means they hire people they like and contract out technical folks. They are not lean and Agile, lots of bloat and middle managers. The environment is extremely political and they accomplish very little. It's extremely hard to get anything done with all bureaucracy, meetings. Lots of non-technical folks blowing hot air and not enough GOOD developers. 90% of their developers are not employees but contractors and turn over is very high. As far as fulltime employees go, Fidelity hires low-level tech folks who have a good attitude but lack experience which further exuberates and compounds not getting things done. Lots of silos and teams that only care about themselves, Cross team communication is probably the poorest I have ever experienced in my career. To add to it all, folks regularly switch teams and so you lose people you trained and you have to start over again. As a whole, in my opinion, it's not a great environment to write and test code in. Everything is always breaking and getting things fixed takes days not hours while your whole team is idle. This encourages idleness and apathy.",5
Bad job but difficult to rate.,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW67624620.htm,2.0,"Aug 6, 2022",Customer Relationship Advocate,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Greenwood Village, CO",Pros,"They license you. You will think about this experience in future jobs and feel relief that you no longer work here. This job is probably more attainable than the vast majority of others job in ""finance"".",Cons,"Ultimately the job title is ""Customer Relationship Advocate"", so I can't fault Fidelity for being dishonest in anyway during recruiting. However, if you are a college graduate looking for a job, even if you failed other interviews, do not take this job if you want to enter a job that is A) financial and/or B) analytical.

Firstly, Fidelity will advertise the SIE/S7/S63 as a good way to begin your career and potentially jump to something else later. These licenses are required from a compliance standpoint, that is the only reason they require you to take them. These licenses will not land you a job as an analyst or impress anyone who actually knows what they are. If you are only joining to take these exams, I advise against this.

Close your eyes. Do you want to take phone calls all day every for the foreseeable future, with the only promotions available being other roles where you get a slight pay bump and take phone calls all day? This is your life after finishing licensing, and if you're like me you will be put on a 10-hour shift against your preference. 10 hours all day every day of talking to customers is not going to make you very desirable in any actual finance or analytical job.

This job is 97.5% customer service and 2.5% finance. Some might argue it is not finance at all, the most sophisticated thing you will do on a daily basis is place a stock order for a customer who is too lazy to do it themselves. You will get trainings on concepts that most customers understand through internet articles, or you will be trained on proprietary systems, nothing you can even place on a resume to show you as a desirable candidate for when you will want to leave.

This job is basically an office version of a factory assembly line. The second you finish a call you're onto the next, there is no opportunity to extend to any meaningful project that will help you get out of the perpetual call center. The job is designed to keep you working for them in a call center, they already licensed and trained you so this is most profitable for them. 

The only person I can see who would like this job is someone who worked in call centers in the past and sees this as an upgrade since they can call themselves a licensed broker etc.

For anyone who wishes to have career advancement outside of customer service or potentially their wealth management branch (you will start off a brand new role, continuing to do calls all day every day and maybe after 3-5 years get promoted to a branch), extend your job search and look elsewhere.

Lastly, the reason I put ""difficult to rate"" in the title is because I might seem naive for giving a poor rating to a customer service job since it doesn't offer promotions into analytical or financial jobs. But ultimately I can't give this job a good rating whatsoever because everyday was dreadful; never-ending phone calls with no hope for meaningful advancement.",12

I'm willing to stumble blindly through an adventure of learning alongside our customers, but many of them don't have time for that, and me not knowing what I'm doing yet is leading to a poor customer experience for them. The headsets provided for working from home aren't compatible with the onsite phones, so that was an unexpected learning curve. My coach strangely seemed perplexed that I didn't know how to operate the call center equipment already on the first day of calls despite never having seen or used that equipment before. It is extremely difficult for clients to hear me clearly, and often vice versa, due to the background conversations when working onsite.

It depends on two things: what department/role you are in, and your manager. My major complaint about WPC is that people who play the game and burn through calls get promoted and those who spend time with clients don’t. You are not encouraged to spend time and plan with a client. You are supposed to get your tool clicks, uncover assets and send a referral to a branch. It has developed a culture of work 12 hour days to get your numbers, or cut corners. 


Also, they required mandatory overtime on Monday’s and Friday’s for over 6 months. Demanding total flexibility from all reps and continually asking for more, more, more. But good luck using your PTO. Some managers will act like you are stealing PTO hours from their own bank when you ask. The “COVID relief days” they offered were total BS as well.

- 4-day work week option 
-Tuition Reimbursement/ Student Loan Repayment
- Gym membership Reimbursement
- Constant Overtime Availability 
-Good resume builder
-Sponsored to get FINRA Licenses
-Work from home",Cons,"CRA ROLE: I graduated with a Bachelor’s in finance last year (degree not required for role) and I took this job b/c they advertised being able to become a licensed financial professional with FINRA. My professor indirectly tried to steer me away from it but I was naive. I sat in on a seminar and was really impressed with how happy everyone seemed. I thought getting my foot in the door I would be able to easily navigate and move on to a more technical skilled role. Boy was I wrong… The CRA role is the lowest of the totem pole you can be on. They try to make you feel like you’re not working in a call center because of licensing and the culture but you really are. You take inbound customer service calls. You get trained and have to assist with a magnitude of differing requests such as the status of paper work or educating/placing trades for clients in margin. It felt like I was getting paid so little to know SO MUCH. You are also expected to work chat function several times a week and manage multiple chat conversations at once. 

The busiest times are Tax Season and the end of the year for RMDs. Summer is the slowest— you most often stare at the screen all day with maybe 5-6 calls your whole 8 hour shift. 

PERFORMANCE/ PROMOTION: You are graded on the criteria of the call model & grading is inconsistent. Additionally, the anxiety you feel when you get calls and don’t know what to expect is difficult. A lot of the clients are older and can be rude when they don’t get their way. You have to help them navigate the website which sometimes can take up to an hour. Clients receive follow-up surveys in 24-48 hours after interaction and if you get a 6 or lower it counts as a 0 towards that metric. A lot of clients are unhappy when they don’t know what they are doing and you get the blame for it instead of allowing you to support and expand their knowledge. Weekends are also tough working b/c a lot of supporting business units are closed on the weekends which results in disgruntled customers and call backs (also, a metric your performance gets graded on)
Fidelity allows auto-promotion when you reach certain call review scores and call metrics. They are just other call center roles with a $1,000-$2,000 yearly salary pay increase. After tax is an extra $50-80 dollars per month. Do not be fooled do the math. 
 
TRAINING/ SUPPORT: You will go through a total of 8 months of training. A lot of information to know. Difficult to retain as you will not be practicing skills daily. If you have a question about a procedure or process managers tell you to contact the Help Desk. Crazy b/c you depend on them to measure and assess your performance but they don’t know the job role specifics. 

Overall, this job left me feeling hopeless and unmotivated. I feel like they should be more transparent with what the job function really is. It is not just about becoming licensed and being a financial professional b/c the clients don’t see you as that, they see you as a customer service representative punching bag. Call center work is not for a lot of people, really think about if this is the type of role you see yourself in permanently.",5

Although their salaries tend to be way below what other companies pay. It's a great place to start, get your certifications, and then go somewhere else where they'll double your pay. This is what most engineers were doing at the time I was there. After I left, I doubled my salary at another firm.",Cons,"I worked at Fidelity from 2018-2019 and found it to be one of the most toxic cultures I’ve ever experienced in my 20+ years as a professional. 
I worked in ECC where, although being a highly technical BU, the Sr leadership (at the time), promoted several non-technical people into leadership positions. I worked under one of these, a woman (HJ) who had a knack for hiring and promoting underqualified people, thereby creating a situation where they needed to be “protected” and would be loyal to her. This included promoting an individual from QA to a PM role with zero experience, as well as someone from the event planning dept to a Dir level leading a UX team. 
The situation was so wily, that at one point, this PM (LV) held several meetings to explain to our highly experienced UX team “UX Strategy”. She’d done her research on Google. I wish I was joking. Later, she would hold “UX Strategy” meetings that only included the one UX designer and a young woman whose role was designing PP decks for leadership (SJ). She insisted on defining herself as the UX Researcher, even though (you guessed it) she had no experience doing research and never actually conducted any research. But she was really good at gossiping, slandering, and keeping VP abreast of BU gossip.  I wish I was joking. These people were not only unqualified and unprofessional, they were MEAN.
The PM for this team created a corrosive and toxic environment; she battled constantly with the PO in front of the full 20+ team, deliberately excluded key players from meetings, showed open aggression in smaller meetings, bullied several individuals, and was just a hostile aggressive person in general.
There was another individual promoted by this VP who not only lacked in technical or leadership skills, but was one of the most badly behaved individuals of the entire team (MVH). She led a team of several people and had the emotional IQ of a 13 YO girl. She also bullied members of her own team, behaved in a hostile manner, openly threated team members, and acted appallingly. When new leadership came in and there was a reorg, she kept her position but lost her entire team. That should tell you all you need to know about Fidelity. The fact that all these people are still employed there is insane.
And make no mistake, the behavior of this group of women was endorsed by their own leadership (HJ). They knew they could get away with it and they did. Tactics included: mobbing, bullying individuals and teams, open aggression in meetings, withholding vital information, excluding individuals from specific team meetings, openly threatening individuals, slandering those who refused to play their game, and even firing those who refused to fall in line or pushed back.
Many associates complained to both HR and the Chairman’s line about this group of women, but the only sense we had that they were taking any actions was when HR executives showed up to an offsite event. But you guessed it, nothing happened. HR exists only to protect the firm. If there are no lawsuits possible, they don’t care.
This “leader” is now a VP in PI and continues her abusive, toxic behavior, as well as promoting only those who show their loyalty to her, as evidenced by the woman she just promoted to Director. In fact, all these women still hold positions at Fidelity. They may be scattered across the enterprise, but it’s just a matter of time until VP brings them all back onto her team and it all begins again.",10

-Good job security
- They hire from within before outside, and there are always opportunities to move laterally. Which is encouraged every 3-5 years or so. 
- Many employee resource groups and support programs. 
- lots of networking opportunities. 
- If you want to gain a certain skill or a certain license, management is usually pretty good at finding a way to let you grow skills, even if that means you will leave your current team. Again, they are big on lateral moves.
- A much more relaxed environment compared to other high-stress brokerage firms.",Cons,"- Depending on your position you can be working very long hours. ( Ie Tax season or ""giving season"" will have you working 8 am-8 pm)
- The pay is lower compared to other brokerage firms. 
- Pay is dependent on seniority, not ability. It's incredibly frustrating to be a top performer in a team, but know you make significantly less than a senior team member, who does not perform well. ( you will get raises but you won't be lifted up to the pay level of a person who has been there for 20 years and has grown complacent) The best way to get raises quickly is through lateral movement and negoation. 
- It is very difficult to get a management position, simply because the company is so big, there is always a large pool of applicants to compete against. 
- Many times when people leave, instead of hiring a new person, they pile that job on an existing team member, but will not raise that team member's pay. Just the expectations. 
- The quality of your manager makes a big difference in your experience. Sadly good managers get promoted and move on to better things, and then a novice is sent to replace them. Great for the managers, bad for the senior team members.",

When I tell other actual advisors what Fidelity does they think it’s criminal, they’re selling cheeseburgers and calling it steak. They want to be the largest RIA in the country but this isn’t it.  The investment management arm of the company (Strategic Advisors) is the RIA. This job is trying to use their watered down planning software to convince customers to buy managed products.  FCs are encouraged (read: compensated) to send the relationship to strategic advisors when it’s closed. This is nothing like a real RIA, trust me I’ve worked at two boutiques.

- Good benefits (very long vesting schedule for some)
- Pay for training/licensing, although Fidelity does have a big problem of reps leaving after being paid to obtain the licenses
- They are currently promoting reps very quickly through the WPA department",Cons,"- Taking phone calls all day long (the majority I had would message you within 5 minutes of not being on the phone, but that could help obviously vary with locations/managers)

- Very high turnover. My team had 5 different managers within 6 months. Reps also leave very quickly to get off the phones. The company really has a plan in place to make their reps stay in the call center as long as possible. Bonus payments are structured to make you feel like it is just close enough to stay for a little while longer. Also a year requirement of work after you obtain your licenses before you can move to a branch role (which are very competitive, and typically are outside hires anyways)

- Extremely sales oriented, but a lot of the clients think we are service. Be prepared for awkward calls where you and the client have completely separate agendas. Instead of servicing the clients need and moving on to help the next, the company would rather you run them through their retirement tools. These tools can be beneficial in some instances, but they are extremely general and many of these clients have recognized that they don’t help much. Seems the department is only here to promote these tools. Only goal on every single call is to take the clients need, acknowledge it while basically ignoring it, run them through the retirement tools so we can gather outside assets, and then set an appointment with a branch so they can move those to Fidelity.

I understand there are plenty of roles similar to this, the only difference is that a lot of the hiring managers at Fidelity do not warn you of this. Multiple reps on my team and I had this same experience.

Overall, this role and the constant phone calls will exhaust you. I would recommend looking elsewhere first if your goal is to get into financial advising. If necessary, this can be a decent role in the short-term.",4

Amazing PTOs about 23 days for all associates that have been here for less than 2 years.

This role requires you to live within 100 miles of Fidelity, yet they do not pay enough for a person to afford to actually live by themselves near Fidelity which is absolutely shameful. It is like being in a minimum wage job except with better pay (though, like I said, still underpaid). You get limited breaks, you are expected to clock in ten minutes early each day, it can be difficult to use your PTO. The customer's rate us on a 7 point scale, but the only acceptable score is 7 points. If you get rated a 6, that is considered failing. This role is very challenging and directly customer facing. There is a lot of pressure because you are dealing with customer's money. Fidelity throws you right into it, I did not feel ready to be moving money for customer's on my own but you just gotta do it. It is great that they sponsor you through the licensing process, but it is really easy to get burned out by their pace. Then, if you fail, prepare to be ""let go."" It is a FINRA rule that licensed employees cannot work from home full time without an exception process that Fidelity is not interested in participating in (it would require them to inspect your home office so I can't blame them for not wanting to do that). We can WFH right now, but will be forced to go in at least part time once it is deemed safe. Fidelity is really pushing for people to return to the office, lots of pressure to participate in ""connect weeks"" which is where you volunteer to go back to the office. They send you a lot of free stuff but most of it is junk. Like cheapy backpacks/mugs/merch you didn't ask for. I am putting this as a con because even though it is nice to receive free things and in the moment it gets you feeling part of the group, this practice has to stop. It is not good for the planet to keep producing useless junk.",14

The pay, the perks, and the people are all great. Fidelity has tried really hard to support employees during COVID, through extra paid leave specifically coronavirus-related, counselor-finding services, fun activities and food provided for people who are willing to come back into the office part time during virus lulls.

Fidelity is also working hard on diversity-and-inclusion, and on making sure employees' voices are heard from the ground up. The company supports outside volunteer efforts and onsite environmental initiatives. You can feel good about working for a company that wants to do good, not just do well.",Cons,"Most people are hired into Fidelity at this position. It's a pretty rigorous process, from submitting the application through multiple interviews. Once you're hired, there are two potential hurdles: first in learning the job then in doing the job.

Oh, the learning process! Even entirely online as it has been since the pandemic, it's kind of fun. There are get-to-know-you activities with your newbie group. But there is also a LOT of information to absorb, and it doesn't let up for months. First you learn the Fidelity systems, then you go through licensing training. You must pass the licensing exams to advance within the company. From hire, this all could take 4-6 months. Yes, they pay you the whole time. Once you're licensed, you alternate more Fidelity-specific classes with actual customer support for a few more months before you settle into full time on the phones. After a few more months of that, you may start applying within the company for new skills and new roles, your options being more self-directed.

So, the cons: the pace of learning is set to warp speed, be prepared! Realize that while you're learning you cost the company quite a bit. It's a lot of stress, but they'll want to push you as fast as they can get you to go. And once you're on the job, well, it depends. Some people like inbound phone customer service, or at least don't mind it. Fidelity customers are usually quite pleasant really. But especially in the busy months, from maybe November through tax season, they can spend more time on hold than they like, which makes them cranky. There will be constant pressure from Fidelity for you to make each call as brief as possible: they will measure both your customer satisfaction stats AND your calls per hour. It can be hard to balance the one against the other. And, this is the job: call after call after call. There are breaks, of course, from weekly team meetings to personal lunch and break time to refresher education. If you can continue in the inbound phones roles long enough, you can eventually get promoted out of it if you choose: perhaps 1-5 years, generally?",2

For many roles, you will have great job security and be extremely well-compensated compared to other companies in the industry doing the same role.

I will say that they do have a vested interest in taking care of their associates and I do feel more valued than I would in other big-name companies.",Cons,"-Does not sponsor you for licensing unless you are in a role that requires it.

Overall most of the cons can be applied to any big corporate organization.

-Job growth and ability to be promoted within is definitely there, but I have seen some people become stuck in their roles if they stay too long or do not develop skills to move onto the next position. 
- In addition, moving up to management can take quite a while. I have seen it happen within the company, but a large number (especially an overwhelming number of upper-level management) either left the company and came back or were recruited externally. However, this is something that can be seen in almost any company you go to. 

- From the above my experience with management has been great, but I know on some high-intensity teams (such as sales or fund management) can have more stressful managers, but I have not heard anything terrible to note.

"Tech divisions lag the market in tooling, processes, comp, management, leadership, dev experience.",https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW58189775.htm,3.0,"Jan 19, 2022",Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",,Pros,The benefits packages are fully-featured and health insurance is affordable. The best perk of Fidelity is the 7% 401k match and the 10% annual profit sharing; 17% contributions to your 401k overall each year. The work/life balance ends up being very reasonable - it would be uncommon to work a 45-hour workweek more than a few times a year. 40 hours is the very common norm.,Cons,"Fidelity does not use public cloud, which has many negative side-effects; they attempt to replicate that experience with older, internal tooling which dramatically slows developer velocity. For example, engineer's ability to access compute resources is blocked by request processes. Libraries are all subject to a security review which can take a small number of weeks if requested with priority, or many weeks without. Licenses are purchased by a remote requisitions team with a similarly slow resolution timeframe. Releases are produced manually, there is no continuous deployment. 

There is no universal devops/platform team, squads maintain their own services. 
This self-sufficiency produces isolation, practically and socially; process standards and tooling varies a fair amount between them. There is no architecture team or unified technical leadership group. Each squad has their own tech lead and that's it.

Pay for engineers lags the market, targeting approximately 80-100% of the market rate. There is no option to acquire equity. ""Chairman shares"" are offered to top performers, but those are simply 2-year vesting cash bonus - not actual equity. Anecdotally, the very talented engineers remain due to not knowing their own market value. 

The manager-to-report ratio can vary wildly, 50+:1 in some cases, offering virtually no manager facetime or development opportunities to members of those squads. The daily routine of managers and directors is primarily comprised of liaising with customers (other business units) rather than anything related to developing their engineering teams.

Because the tech groups service internal business units, customer requirements are often poorly defined, change frequently and are conveyed verbally to product managers over calls. Oftentimes a change will be reverted due to a customer's whim, not the functionality of the feature itself.

Leadership is adamant about working from the office and will not support remote work post-covid.

Leadership has frequent messaging about undergoing an agile transformation, yet none of the shortcomings described here are eligible for reevaluation. The remaining set of factors that can be changed are virtually meaningless in impact.

Talented top-level leadership want to lead other business units which are revenue centers (all are financial business units) rather than cost centers, so the tech groups end up with a steady rotation of SVPs (the head of the tech group, equivalent to a CEO elsewhere) every 1-2 years. 

In short, the engineer experience at Fidelity is stable, yet slow, uninspiring, and poorly-compensated when compared to the broader market.",1

I've interviewed several times with a 20 to 1 ratio for applicants vs. positions offered. Everyone that stayed made a lateral move within the company. They changed positions but didn't get a bump in pay. A lot of promises and motivational meetings are given on career mobility, but most can't move anywhere easily. Climbing the ladder takes years. For most, it takes a lot of education, experience, and exceptional stats. I saw a guy with a CFP, 3 years of financial advisement experience, a degree in finance, and excellent testing/current role scores lose a job to a woman with 1-year furniture sales experience. He couldn't move out for a long time. I've seen that happen to several people where the promotions were not fair based on diversity hiring. Qualified people get passed up frequently for diverse applicants. I worked with several people that had multiple years of financial experience and a few that had MBA's that didn't move any easier than people in their 2nd year of college. Experience/education/certifications don't help very much. Lots of people apply for every job.

Night time Differential pay at 5% for folks who work past 6 PM. That increases to 20% for those who work past 8 PM of your eligible based compensation per hour. 

Christmas bonuses 2 to 3 times every five years. Usually 1 pay period awarded. There have been other types of incentive pay depending on call volume to encourage us to not cancel auto OT when applied awarded in cash, stock grants, one day off, Fidelity cash for merchandise, etc.

No weekend requirements for those supporting workplace roles. Personal investments roles may have weekend hours depending on the job.

More Telework is available due to Covid19.

Real career development exit here. Some managers are better at this than others. I’ve always felt that they’re pushing me to take up the next challenge. Even at times when I wasn’t ready to move up or just getting complacent.

Fun stuff at call centers. Choose any of these clubs: Women in Leadership, Aspire, FidVets, FinTech, President Circle, Leadership Summit, etc... they always have something going on for you to network and use to move on up. It’s up to you to hustle and play the game.

Pre Covid19 we had hot air balloon rides, dragon boat competitions, BBall breaks, volleyball teams, zombie nights for Halloween, BBQ competitions, ice cream socials, team outings, camping trips, visiting chefs at some sights, team potlucks, free food and I’m talking about the good stuff NOT pizza. You can definitely gain major weight at certain sites.

No worries because some sites have a full service gym w/ personal trainers, classes, and nutritionists.

 At Our sites we got the choice to take a walk and discuss our development plans or monthly business results around one of the many nature trails.",Cons,"Bonus metrics change a lot.

Managers depending on the site location change a lot in the call centers for sure.
 
Will push you hard to keep up with the ever changing metrics in order to stay relevant if you want to get promoted. Only to hire a guy off the street to the branch with 6 months of car sales experience, no degrees in the field, and has to still get his S7 & 63.

You have a better chance of jumping a few slots to get to where you want if you work at Fidelity for 1-3 years. Quit; then work elsewhere for 1-2 years only to come back to Fidelity.

Serious issues at to many of the branches when it comes to hiring women, professionals with ascents, or they may serve in locations with above average demographics or immigrants without one person in the branch that can speak their language. These folks tend to have small to midsize size businesses. They horde cash and don’t have someone they trust to reach out to them. However, executive management is aware and working on making the hiring process better. I can tell that change is happening. It’s not HQ more so the mindset of the financial industry at the local levels. 

Management feedback for the interview process can be largely lackluster. Heard from other top performers that the feed back was non existent or borderline suspect. Being told to smile more during the interview or joke more at team meetings is NOT productive feedback for a job interview. Especially when they seem to selectively provide this to certain “types.”

Healthcare plan is average. Family plan is 3k high deductible. They do give you $1500 per year to your HSA to offset that high @-&:?:?’ Plan. Prescription med and co pays prices were higher for me than my previous employer.

Pay is actually lower than the national average for a license professional.",3

Abby Johnson attempting to create the cult called Fidelity is failing and outflow at the firm is coming. They’re anti-fiduciary approach will cost them majorly with the CFP Board.

 They take no feedback from employees with knowledge of this and other things that are unethical and would violate even Reg BI.

Recruiters will tell you that unless you have a CFA Level I upon graduation from an Ivy League school , or you can never be an analyst. After LinkedIn review this is not true, and I cross referenced who didn’t qualify for those “standards” I found those not from Ivy League had some nepotism within the company, generally at a VP or higher level 

This east coast bias here is incredible. Call centers everywhere else-with about 1/5 the pay of anyone in Massachusetts. 

I don’t recommend this firm to anyone. They’ll preach a holistic happy fun approach- the reality is nothing close. 

Abby Johnson just because you were born into the most successful mutual fund company- does not mean anyone should worship you the way it’s demanded from the top down. It’s actually pretty pathetic you feel the need to plaster your own quotes and face everywhere.

So many perks and benefits I literally cant fit it all on here.",Cons,"Ever ask yourself ""How can I simultaneously destroy my career prospects and waste my expensive college degree?"" Well then , Fidelity Investments in Jacksonville has the perfect job for you! 

First, it's a call center people...through and through. You will talk to dozens of people on the phone. Every...single...day. Eventually, that ""ding!"" sound of a new call coming in will haunt your dreams. Most people don't last more than a year. You can either go the sales or service route. If you go service, there is very little room for advancement. In addition, if you move into whats called a ""High Net Worth"" service role, you will be responsible for a HUGE range of knowledge and actions without commensurate pay. One call could have you rushing to get a complex option trade placed within minutes of market close, while a pushy day trader berates you, and the next call could be spending an hour helping a 90 year old man reset his password as you bang your head on you desk asking ""I went to college for this?!"" If you go sales, then get used to working long, awkward hours and having your success defined in how many more calls you can take than the next guy/gal. 

The coupe de grace (ATTENTION ALL RECENT COLLEGE GRADS): None of the jobs they offer in Jacksonville are real finance jobs. They're just customer service/sales jobs parading as something fancier. Even the ""Financial Advisor"" roles are just sales, albeit well paying. Also, call center jobs are only marketable to other customer service careers. Having a call center job on your resume will actually HARM your chances of landing a job in world of ACTUAL finance. So, before you go thinking ""I'll just work here for a year or two to get something on my resume""....DON'T DO IT.

None of what I just said should reflect poorly on the company itself, because Fidelity is a great company in terms of culture, mission, and values. That's undeniable. The problem is very specific to the extent of their operations in Jacksonville being call center based and that these are very stressful and career-limiting work environments. Consider yourself warned!",10

But, because its Fidelity, the clients wait for 50-200 minutes or more to speak with you, they are, as you would expect, not happy by the time you speak with them. (These are the clients filling out your survey, and only PERFECT surveys count). The queue of clients to speak to is endless. Over time the bad attitudes and angry people yelling at me wore me down and I lost 15 lbs, because skinny anxious and depressed, and essentially sacrificed my personal self to chase my professional goal to move to a different job where the clients don't wait as long. However, the rhetoric and promise of changing jobs, the date keeps getting pushed back. Now they are refusing to do internal promotions, due to the egregious client hold times. This is a LOSING TEAM. Go join a winning team. 

If you don't live there already, you have to move to the city to WFH

No real team atmosphere

Clients yelling at you and disrespecting you.

In the words of management ""this is the bottom of the company""

In the words of my former manager ""this is the hardest year at the company, and this is the worst version of the hardest year at the company ever""

Except, this year is different, because the company is literally NOT PROMOTING the loyal employees who worked through the hell of December-March.

If you call Fidelity this upcoming December 2021, you will experience an unacceptable hold time of at least 70 minutes, and you will work with someone brand new and incompetent.

Since I joined, my class of 30 people, about 14 have quit or been fired for yelling back at clients, or failing their Finra exams.

Again, I cannot emphasize enough, this is a LOSING TEAM and the teflon-covered management give you lip-service about the future getting better, yet the carrot gets pushed farther and farther away.

Even in this terrible environment, when my peers got only 40% ""perfect surveys"" my record month was 91%.

I have been asking for help since January to get into a different role that fits my background and skillset.

Very positive corporate culture.,Cons,"Ever ask yourself  ""How can I waste my finance degree AND make myself less marketable at the same time?"" Well, have I got a job for you! Sarcasm aside, let's just be brutally honest here. COLLEGE STUDENTS/GRADS PAY ATTENTION!!! Unless you plan to become an advisor (cough...salesman), most of the jobs you will find in the world of personal investments/brokerage services are going to be a CALL CENTER JOB! This is just the nature of the beast, yet something that your career counselor at college probably wont tell you. Call center experience is only a marketable skill to more customer service jobs.  I have worked at Fidelity for several years and can honestly say that I feel I have wasted years of my life doing something I have grown to absolutely despise. Dealing with customers on the phone is a life-draining experience. So let's bring it back to Fidelity, shall we? Would you like a real-life sample of what your job will consist of as a ""Financial Representative"" or ""Customer Advocate"" at Fidelity? Well, say no more!:

8:00 a.m. - Distribution check request.
8:10 a.m. - Hour long password reset with 90 year old client. (College degree hard at work!)
9:10 a.m. - Distribution check request.
10:10 a.m. - Help client find tax form online. 
10:15 a.m. - Why wont my debit card work?
10:25 a.m. - Why wont my credit card work?
10:35 a.m. - Complex multi-leg option trade.
10:45 a.m. - 30 minute password reset with 80 year old client. ( I went to college for this?)

Now rinse and repeat this for 30 calls a day, day in and day out. Not exactly what you pictured yourself doing with that shiny, expensive college education, is it?
Look...I could go on and on about other details of the job (particularly the wacked-out survey questionnaire Fidelity bases a large portion of your bonus on) but I'll leave that for some other disenchanted soul. Here is the bottom line...if you want to do sales, that is great for you and you will find many career opportunities at any brokerage firm, including Fidelity, and you will make a great living doing so. However, if sales is not your thing then I highly suggest you look elsewhere.",77

Upon resignation of the firm all previous connections will instantly dissolve.  Senior management uses smiles and positive speeches to squash any and all critiques/feedback of existing processes.

After a couple years, trust me, you'll be begging to get out of their militant and lack of resource style. Managers know nothing about your role, as Fidelity typically hires managers with no knowledge of the role as they believe managers are their to ""manage"" and not need be experts at the technical aspects of the role. With that said, where do you go for guidance? Glad the police, fire department or pilots aren't hired Fidelity style. Who is the go to contact if your manager doesn't have a clue about the day to day of your job? Being a manager is a great deal at Fido as they have zero accountability and throw you under the bus if need be. I've been there 7 years and have a rockstar performance record, so this review is not in spite, rather it's just reality. Get in, get your license and experience on their dime, get out.

Some groups work in crowded arrangements because leadership will not support any official work from home arrangements.
Lack of oversight on Directors and Vice Presidents with direct reports. A bad apple can really tear a department apart. 
Review process is not individual. People are stack ranked and there are quotas on high ratings. Even if you have 2 star performers, only 1 can receive the most excellent rating. The process is truly not individualized.
People provide reviews for employees they have had very little interaction with. Can get very personal.

You are told when you are hired and during training that customer service and advocating for the customer is the main goal.  That you should ""own the call"". However as soon as you are on the phones, you are told that once the customer is handed off to what ever dept ,  you should not be involved anymore, that you should not make too many outbound calls to the customers because we are an inbound call center , I do not consider this owning anything.  The procedures and resources are time consuming and cumbersome.  Your computer is prone to freezing when you are in the middle of a call because of all of the resources you have to have up,  and yet you can not say anything about your computer not working properly. 
  Fidelity has compassion as part of it's mission statement , yet most of the procedures could not possibly show less compassion for the customer if they tried.  In short I feel like I was lied to about the position I was hired for.   
   Management shows favoritism as well as cliquishness, and though everyone appears to be friendly it is surface only.  You never know what management expects or what they are in charge of  because it changes constantly.",6

I truly love Fidelity and what they stand for. I just hate the role I'm in.",Cons,"The role just sucks, especially if you work nights because they never hire enough people to work late nights so people can wait up to 10 minutes just for a password reset! It's a call center so it's constantly taking call after call and people can be too needy or hostile because they can't treat their retirement account like an ATM. You have to be in the role for at least a year to even be considered for other roles though it will just be another job on the phone all day. Also your calls are graded all the time and depending on your manager... it's a miracle if you do anything right on a call. Some people call in to get a balance and just because you didn't get the persons life story doesn't mean the call was ""inconsistent"". Metrics are so whack.",9

Benefits used to be among the best in the industry but that has fallen in recent years.,Cons,"In my department advancement, whether in the form of formal promotions or stretch assignments, go only to those with contacts at higher levels.  Midlevel managers routinely tell subordinates that they believe the subordinates deserve advancement but that none is available unless the subordinate can figure out a way for senior managers to take notice.  Senior managers don't believe this is a problem because they see promotions going to the people they know are good.  They are oblivious to how many good people work there that they don't know.  That is because people rise to the top at Fidelity by managing up, not managing down.

There are two types of senior managers.  One is the Fidelity Lifer who understands how to play the game.  Don't try to change anything, don't take any chances, figure out how to not get your finger prints on anything that might fail and know that after 20 years you can retire extremely wealthy.  The other is the short timer who comes in from another company expecting to get things done.  They take chances, they get involved in new projects that take the company in new directions and they are the first to be blamed when things fail.  These people rarely last long.",5

I was an employee for over 12 years and always felt I was underpaid at the base salary.  They don’t seem interested in retaining hard working, SP rating employees who execute on the work.

Career oops: they are all into talking about mobility right now but it seems to be towards more younger employees to keep them engaged.

If associates don’t want to go into sales, the only other option is management, which is often not a good fit. You’d have managers who just weren’t “people” people, who would be leading a team of 20+. Managers also have the ability to make or break your career. They control your pay, bonuses, reviews and even promotions. I don’t believe one (possibly inept) person should have control over basically your life. Favoritism runs rampant, which is awesome if you’re a favorite, sucks if you’re not. I had many managers, some who loved me and would mentor and promote me and sing my praises from the rooftop, and then others who gave me very low performance reviews (how is this possible?) 

They’re just SO HUGE with so many different business groups that people wouldn’t know what jobs are out there.

A company that is interested more in protecting management with an emphasis on the org chart and less about the work itself. Constant internal battles and intentional reorganizations. An internal employee goal program that ignores how you want to grow as an individual instead focusing on how a manager wants you positioned. If you get a good manager that focuses on the work it can be a wonderful place but soon there will be a reorg and and you will find yourself having to pay more attention to the political back channels and less on your passions and skill set. Politics is extended externally as well with profits spent on preventing governmental ""regulation"" but internally a love of regulating the employee. Highly protectionist from the top on down.

Very good pay and benefits. 

Culture depends on the division you're in -- I used to work in Strategic Advisers, Inc. (later rolled up into Asset Allocation) and the majority of the people that I worked with in that group were incredibly nice and smart. I'd heard not-so-great things about some of the other divisions at Fidelity, though, so I counted myself fortunate. Compared to the other floors in my building (245 Summer St), my floor was relatively casual and the floor plan was more open -- large half-cubes instead of the cube farms at the Smithfield, RI campus. Because I worked on a floor with portfolio managers and other members of investment management, we also got nicer drinks in the fridge.

I also had a very kind and nurturing manager and a good team.",Cons,"Even within the division that I worked in, there were a few deadweights -- people who had made it to middle management after being at the company for 15+ years and were really just complacent and there for the paycheck. Those people were always a drag to work with; fortunately, I was able to minimize my dealings with them and usually partnered with the research and investment teams, who were filled with smart, driven people.

One other con was that it IS a big corporation, so change does come fairly slowly, and there are constant re-orgs and re-branding initiatives, which can get a bit difficult to keep track of. It can also be hard to get things done in an efficient manner because there are always a million stakeholders on each project.",

Compensation: The base pay (at least for my role) is way too low for what I do. 

Job: My job itself is manageable but stressful at times already. When people leave, they put that person's job on other people, with no raise or any acknowledgment of how the person's doing. The job you add on, you may not even be qualified for under in the industry. Also, they add on useless tasks to do (that other locations don't do) just for no reason at all. We have all of these tasks to do with no extra pay or help from higher management. The higher up people do not even know how to do the jobs we have which I can say from my experience here for sure.

Customers: some of the clients are absolutely absurd. they come in asking for things and you try to help them and give them caring honest answers and they dont care. it just adds on to the stress.

Company: During the pandemic they've put completely unrealistic protocols that do not make the clients happy (not being able to walk in places). Although I understand it's important to be safe during the pandemic, other companies allow it, so why not here? This just makes the clients very angry, more than already about their needs, and they go off on us service reps as if it is our fault. We take the heat. When we present it to a manager they do not care and tell us to try to resolve it more. If it escalates too much to a manager then they just blame the company and seem not to care. 

P.S. If you have a fidelity account and need help, do NOT call the service number because there is a 1% chance someone will answer in the first 10 minutes.",6

Job security is above average,Cons,"I want to set everyone straight on this company.  
This is a financial sales company, not a financial services firm.  The goal year in and year out is to maximize sales at the cost of providing true financial planning services to clients and developing relationships.
Book sizes are over 500 and by nature, representatives have little incentive to interact with current book clients unless there is new money coming in.  Reps are constantly not following up with their own clients because there is no incentive to stay true to a relationship model.  The planning is a masked service, run by computers and over complicated pieces of marketing material.  When each ""solution"" for a client is a fidelity managed account, you start to question what actual planning you are really doing.  If I client does not want a managed account, there is barely anything you can do for them, besides show them how to research on their own, defeating the purpose of a ""guidance"" appointment.  Management is constantly looking at ways to better the years previously at the cost of the reps and the clients.  More appointments, more phone calls is the name of the game.  It is impossible to keep a relationship model when this is the driving force behind it.  

If you want to provide financial planning guidance in a more meaningful way, it is best to join an RIA, which is where fidelity is losing most of its staff to anyway.",8

You might have managers or trainers that have never been in your seat, or could not cut it so they transitioned. Makes it difficult to have them coach when they have not done it.

During this time of unprecedented change, it seems the place has become even more political and bureaucratic. Personally, I think Rodger Lawson is a much needed shot-in-the-arm for the company and has done much to infuse new leadership at the top. However, the next few levels down are in turmoil and disarray. Political infighting, turf wars, back-stabbing...it couldn't be further from the goals and objectives that Rodger laid out when he arrived at Fidelity. I think he would be stunned if he knew the truth about how some of his senior leaders were making decisions during the recent waves of layoffs, how good (but ""non political"") talent was being purged from the company, how things were being done more for ""optics"" than actual results. There are still many S and E level VPs in the company that need to find some religion...or seek other pastures.",7
BEWARE!!,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW40561033.htm,1.0,"Jan 12, 2021",Anonymous,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Durham, NC",Pros,They allowed workers to work from home.,Cons,"Where do I start? I spent a decent amount of time working at Fidelity. Overall, I would say it’s not a great company to work for at all. From my observations, many people have gotten stuck in this company, and it’s drained the life/soul out of them. For starts, many full-time and contractors (Fidelity TalentSource) are underpaid for the amount of responsibility on them. Many people are very unhappy here, but their soul has been trapped here way too long. They don’t know how to leave; all they know to do is stay around and complain.

Racism is obvious in this company. After the murder of George Floyd and many others, there was a lot of lip service from upper-level leaders and money donated to non-profits, but the core of this company has not changed at all. It’s racist!

Human Resources and Recruiters for the most part are awful. I think this is one of the MANY reasons why they don’t attract quality candidates, let alone keep them exceptionally long. Speaking of that, turnover is HIGH.

The leadership is really what makes or breaks an organization. The leadership here is awful. I met with a Senior Leader about issues with a product that they oversaw, and they admitted it was problematic and had obvious issues. However, since our meeting nothing about the product has improved, it’s only gotten worst. Do companies think by ignoring constant issues/problems that they’re just going to float away?

I conclude by saying, proceed with caution. Don’t let the nice buildings, benefits, etc. fool you. Once you get in, you will soon realize it was a BIG mistake coming here. You deserve better in life, STAY AWAY!!",19

Between its low cost platform to invest and its fabulous benefits, Fidelity sets the bar high.",Cons,"The only concern I have with Fidelity is that it doesn't do enough to root out managers with direct reports who violate its values. The lack in accountability of its managers isn't unique to Fidelity. Yet, it's disappointing considering it sincerely strives to standby things it espouses. Everyone knows who these bad actors and bad apples are. Members of their teams can't move away fast enough to other teams, departments, or companies. 

Though the company allows them to punish or push out struggling yet sincere frontline employees, it does little to recognize that these ineffective managers are better at managing up to their bosses than lifting up their teams. Just recently, I saw a manager who was recently promoted to an enviable post who has a seriously horrible reputation. He is a poster child of everything I mentioned and is one of the worst managers in the building.",2

There is virtually no on-boarding for new hires and new hires are treated badly by colleagues. You have to have a very thick skin and be willing to stand your ground in the face of some rude treatment. The environment can be quite stressful and some department management seems almost proud of the level of stress. When interviewing be sure to ask about the group's culture rather than the whole company's culture. Performance reviews can be problematic with some management teams. Most divisions require mangers to work with direct reports to establish goals and objectives.

I have worked here for almost 10 years and I get to do my job, the help desks job, and the new hires job, and don't get so much as a thank you.

After this, you'll have dedicated project time where you work on a real project within Fidelity Investments. A great plus is, you get paid during training. You'll learn things such as front end, middle tier, and back end technologies. You are basically getting equipped for your future role within the company. You work closely with your manager and they'll try to find the best role for you. Ie, if you want to work more on front end(html/css/angular), they'll try to find the best role for you. 

Trust me, as a recent college graduate, this program is unreal. It truly is a gateway to success for your Software Engineering career. It helps you get your feet wet, and feel the least bit comfortable to get off to a good start. 

Here is a list of Pros:
- 401k match (7% at 100%) + ~10% profit sharing (Ie: its ultimately 17% 401k match)
- Student Loan Assistance (Up to $10,000) 
- Great networking along the way (You are in classrooms with recent graduates just like you. Great life long friendships and connections were made!)
- Learning Front End, Middle Tier, Back End Technologies (The general ones Fidelity uses.... and no, these aren't legacy software technologies)
- Learning coding concepts/design patterns",Cons,There aren't really any cons. You are getting paid to learn(say what?). It is what you make of the program.,1

Great health plan. Lots of vacation. Job Security. Great place to begin a career in Sales/Financial Planning. Great customer focus (in terms of interactions and handling issues). Great Integrity. One of those companies where it would take blatant action to intentionally hurt the client interaction to lose your job.,Cons,"Middle to Upper Middle management are pretty unqualified. When there is a problem with a system or process the resolution is to take down a list of everything that's broken, sit and wait to see how many customers complain about it over the course of 1-3 years, then prioritize funding to fix the issue, then make a video about how terrible the process is and show it to all of the employees in some sort of a backwards way to show their great problem resolution technique, and then maybe after 2 years its fixed. Meanwhile, front line employees have to constantly make excuses to clients and maintain a ""can do"" attitude.",3

Just get out of it as quick as you can, as it beats you down once the aura of the new job wears off.",Cons,"You are responsible for the whole office even though you typically are the least experience person in the office.  It's a great way to learn, but also a great way to have employees above you dislike you if you make a mistake.  The position can be quite demeaning as you order lunches for associates above you and will be treated like a secretary on numerous occasions throughout the week.  You are ordered around more so than any other employee in the office.  You are responsible for the whole office, but all the other employees are responsible just for themselves so you can get pulled many ways at once to keep people happy and of course, this typically will not help you be happy.",

Top of the line training for licensing should your role require it off the bat, or sometime down the line.

The workplace culture is excellent- every single manager I've had is excellent, and that's likely a result of trickle-down from *their* higher ups. Willingness to accomodate work from home is an excellent push, as long as you're okay with online training.",Cons,"Certain products like the one I work with currently very much feel like they're on the backburner when it comes to updating resources, educating customers, etc. It makes a call with an insane hold time even more distressing, and just leads to more OT asks. I've had the term ""F for flexibility"" thrown around more times than I can count. Having covid PTO is great, but the distressing air of the call center floor makes associates feel almost guilty for not doing OT, nevermind taking days off during ""peak season"", which, since the pandemic, has been virtually every day. I love what I do and I love assisting customers- but beware, if call center work is exhausting to you, it's going to outweigh most pros I'm giving here.",

I started right out of college 2 years ago and the starting salaries are competitive. Plus, you get amazing benefits such as dollar for dollar match on 401K up to 7%. In addition they give you 10% of your salary for profit sharing at the end of the year. I have worked with a lot of very intelligent people that challenge me everyday to make me better. I enjoy the challenge because if we aren't helping each other improve and to learn new things a job can get stale very quickly.",Cons,"While the salaries are competitive at the beginning the raises are almost none existent. And, to get a promotion is even more difficult. If your looking for somewhere to grow quickly then Fidelity isn't the place for you unless your lucky. Also, there is a lot of politics involved in this company. You will see coworkers move past you that are terrible at their jobs (borderline clueless as to what is going on), but network very well and talk to the right people. This can be very discouraging to those who actually try and work hard. Because, at the end of the day your picking up their slack and they're reaping the benefits.",9

- On-site management teams have always been understanding of personal situations or need for time off on short notice
- Great opportunity to learn the industry
- Very customer friendly environment and great brand recognition",Cons,"- Too beaurocratic - front line employees are asked to provide feedback to upper management on ways to improve but little is acknowledged, much less acted on
- Upon hiring they promote career opportunity, and even managers state career developement is something they want to help out with, but unless you want to do sales and/ or be tied to a phone doing different levels of customer service, very little career growth exists unless you have the right connections
- Compensation seems to be appropriate for entry level jobs but does not keep pace as you do move through the company
- Severe disconnect between upper managment and front line employees
- Contracting expectations - they promote world class customer service as being the number one priority in this particular role, but great interactions are rarely rewarded, and sales are what most non-base pay compensation is tied to",1

On the tech side PI is one of the most modern whereas FI is stuck in the early 1990s. My group is excellent and for Fidelity we are on the cutting edge. Work life balance is great - in general the management is very flexible. There are politics but a good manager will shield the developer from this. If you can prove your valuable by innovating Fidelity will take notice - if you do nothing new then you will stagnate. Base compensation is on the lower end of what a developer could make elsewhere but the wide array of benefits, especially the contributions to 401k (7% match and generally 10% profit sharing) are unheard of. Senior management seems to have a clear vision of what they want but the execution on it by middle management is variable.",Cons,"So much of Fidelity's tech is old and maintaining, enhancing the existing systems and building new capabilities requires lots of investment which up until the year the company had been pouring money into. In my opinion some of this money was wasted on buying expensive vendor products from the likes of IBM and Oracle that could have been done without paying for a license. Another issue is Fidelity still hires too many useless contractors and unnecessary project managers.",3

Service used to get paid well if you worked your way to the top, however, Fidelity recently restructured variable compensation and top performing reps are taking up to a $10,000 pay cut. While they cut your pay they are asking you to do twice the work by consolidating roles and drastically increasing calls per hour expectations. Expect to  handle complex problem resolution on matters like alternative investments, international wires, or incorrect cost basis research all while taking 7 calls per hour.  You will get paid around $50,000  for practically handling every aspect of service for all clients and financial consultants who very likely know less than you but get paid over twice as much.

On the whole I was treated very well, but it was about what I put into it.  I felt that I worked hard and was rewarded (promotion and $ wise) appropriately.   As with any big company, your success is very dependent on your supervisor and how they choose to treat their staff.  But I always felt that if you worked hard and performed well, you got what you deserved.  Benefits are very good and I felt I more than compensated fairly for my work.",Cons,"Fidelity by nature is risk averse because of its reputation and that is also it's biggest issue when it comes to innovation.  Fidelity, for all it's lip service as a leading edge company, is behind the curve on technology and is working to make strides in cloud services and robo investing services to keep up with more innovative companies attempting to steal the millennial generation market.  In addition, there is no real accountability within technology operations (including the need to really measure performance against budget) so there is a lot of stagnation among long-time employees and in  management.  Fidelity moves very slowly on re-orgs and layoffs after telegraphing changes are coming, leaving employees in limbo for long periods and impacting productivity.",3

If your a person of color as well there is no diversity at the the maagement level besides one woman of Asian heritage. Expect if you are white to be promoted even though you're not the most qualified for the role. Expect to be accused of being bad on the phone when you did everythign you did for a client yet they give you a bad rating for the 1 hour hold time they waited to talk to you, and the best part is then the company will use that against you to screw you out of your bonuses saying you didn't do a great job. Of course, there is no way to throw out the ones that that were just an upset customer and not your fault. We were told they didn't have money for raises then they cut their commissions and magically found a way to still give us a raise. They do not do any cost of living adustments so expect to live harsh while some people live comfortable in other states. So pretty much expect to be disregarded at this company they don't care about you.",3

The information you discuss with clients is more complicated than other phone jobs, so you'll be relying on internal information systems since you can't know every little policy or acronym.

The people at Fidelity are smart, friendly and uniformly desire to do the right thing.",Cons,"Terrible disconnect between senior management and the people below them. Poltiical maneuvering among senior leaders is widespread, a result of C-level unwillingness to set direction clearly or resolve conflicts decisively. Company culture is consensus-driven - often from the bottom up in that individuals, groups and teams are left to work things out themselves - and when issues among teams arise that cannot be resolved below the SVP level, they remain unaddressed and left to fester until things get bad enough that someone senior HAS to step in, usually with more fallout than would have been necessary if the problem had been addressed earlier. There is a serious blind spot when it comes to recognizing the limits of consensus-building and the fact that leadership by directive is sometimes necessary.  Micro-managing is common, and far, far too much time is spent on producing presentations and reports.",1

Team managers have entirely too much power and there is very little recourse given to appeal their decisions or seek redress of grievances when they act in an inappropriate manner. The pay is well below industry standards and while you are able to make lateral movements within the company, moving up is EXTREMELY difficult. Pay raises rarely keep up with inflation and while I was there our variable comp was changed making it impossible for anyone to meet the new standards. My pay went down a couple of thousand dollars per year as a result. HR is not responsive and negligent at times. I went an entire year without insurance because I was somehow disenrolled in the plan that I signed up for when I got hired on. HR knew that this mistake had happened and it was documented in their system, but they didn't do anything in time to correct the problem despite my contant pressuring them.

It seemed like we would go through 3-4 organizational alignments each year.  It's not that it's bad, but they never seem to be able to stay the course with their decisions.

Your breaks are timed/measured, the length of your calls is measured (long calls = baaaaaad,) and getting promoted outside of the department takes an act of congress.
Management, in general, is a bunch of glad-handing guys and gals.  You seldom see managers let go/demoted, even if they are consistently poor performers/coaches.

If you’re a minority keep your head down and do your work. This company lies about everything and makes up their own rules that goes against their written policy. If you are faced with a discrepancy, chain of command does not help. Managers are very controlling and seek to sabotage careers if they could. Micromanagement is very real in this workplace, management will yell at you in front of others and back each other up to make you look “combative”. Constant changes, no resolutions for errors the company is making. So basically you’re taking the brunt of the heat from clients all day. The pay is horrible, the managers try to make it seem like your raise is a lot, when in reality at most the raises won’t raise you above the $40k threshold. The company isn’t for the best interest of the client don’t believe that I’ve seen so much where Fidelity does things to hurt the client more than help them. I can write a book about this place. Don’t waste your mental health here and it’s a lie if you think that upward mobility is possible. I had a manager try to make sure I didn’t desire to be a manager because she didn’t want me trying to “take” her job.",11

Most promotions go to younger less experienced reps and those that have ""branded themselves""  properly. IMO the ""Brand"" they seek is someone that never questions anything and is perceived to have a clean slate that they can mold to do things as they say ""The Fidelity Way' . My new employer values my experience and sees it as an asset rather than a liability.

Most opportunities are lateral and involve little or no pay increase 

They are so concerned with everyone staying within their predefined roles that customers get passed to 3,4, even 5 people just to get a 401K rolled over. Along the way each rep is charged with getting some sort of lead.",1

The call center should have a more regular office-like environment and employees should be able to take their time with customer cases-- including necessary off-the-phone time (such as faxing, e-mailing, and account maintenance) without having to jump through hoops to do so.
The customers can be difficult to deal with and really unkind. Most people will be reasonable, but each day there are bound to be at least a few calls in which people are truly frustrated and you just have to have a thick skin about it or find another job.
Like with any job, there is always one manager who is very difficult to deal with. In the case of where I worked, this team manager ended up making the majority of her team quit because of her attitude. I'm lucky that I was placed with one of the other, excellent managers instead of her.",4

Due to cost cutting, departments are not budgeted fully (over the past 10 years or so) and goals of individual departments are not aligned to the corporate goals (except when it comes to cutting costs).

Another con is the phones are constantly ringing there is no break between calls as soon as the caller hangs up the next call is already through and you have to be ready.
If you want a job outside of the field you are in you have to wait a year to get to a different sector.
There are so many goals they want done on every call, you have to maintain a relationship with the caller, ask protruding personal questions of why they want to take out money out of THEIR 401ks, you have to get a guidance opportunity in where you feel like a seller, you have to get a PCC in where you talk about how much they are putting in their 401k...etc, etc. the list goes on, you have to get so much done in one call, every call.",6

I was there 7 years was give great feedback during review time but managers always found a reason not to give me a raise ( I received on raise the entire time I was employed). One made up reason given when my manager spent a min tripping over her words to think of what to come up with was that she heard I spend to much time in the ladies room (of course it was not true but it was good enough for her to justify when I again would not receive a raise) Most of my managers were up north therefore  managed at a distance and visited maybe every three months per year.

We were fully licensed brokers, but the majority of my time was spent doing password resets and distributions - I'm not sure why the firm would pay our licensing fees only to have us perform repetitive tasks any (unlicensed) customer service rep can do. Dealing with the general public is trying - people will call in and scream/curse at you over something you had no control over.

Lastly, depending on the level you are hired at (i.e. 25, 27, 29) you will not be eligible for the full, advertised bonus. This is the great unspoken fallacy of this position.

Easy competition for the stack rank. It's fairly new so it isn't micromanaged yet but it is trending that direction. More relaxed than other roles in the phone site.,Cons,The compensation is much less than what it should be for the money you move in and service provided. Confusing bonus structure that is constantly changing and bonus is dictated by manager entirely and not by production and stack rank so it can be very bias. In reality the stack rank is pointless cause 2nd place can get a bigger bonus than 1st. It is starting to become more and more micromanaged. It has become more of an efficiency role instead of quality even though the main point is sales and not service. Very unorganized part of the company. It's a little niche compared to the rest of the company so there is constant change and no one including directors know what's going on in the future. Also misrepresented growth opportunities.

It didn't matter that I had over 10 years of valuable experience in Fidelity with plenty of other transferable skills.  How is someone supposed to get the xxx experience if you're not given the opportunity?  

Way too many re-orgs and RIFs with the loss of really good people. This leaves others to pick up their work when employees are already overloaded with their own work.

Most Product Managers are incompetent and have only been promoted because someone got laid off or quit for greener pastures.Almost impossible to get promoted by merit/hard work.

HR also reminds people that Fidelity only pays 75% of your worth in the Market Place. So the base salaries are quite low.

There were a few situations where individuals with consistently outstanding numbers never got promoted to positions they earned. I personally knew such a person and from speaking to him it was due to some issues with his manager.

When I was there, Fidelity implemented a terrible business plan which made service's function more like sales. It was done by making certain metrics, one is evaluated on, excessively high for sales like responsibilities. By the time I left, these metrics had been adjusted to more reasonable numbers. However, the service department still had a major roll in bringing in new money, without any compensation other than miniscule quarterly bonus.

We were all told (by the president of a business unit) that pay would not be negatively affected by an operating model change. I know multiple people who's salaries were adjusted down.

Upper management is extremely patronizing. Though they attempt to cover it up there is very much a culture of ""Mommy/Daddy knows best"" when it comes to making decisions. This thought process is extremely embedded into culture there; so much so that despite a huge organizational change, my team's day-to-day work is still prioritized by a person who is two or three pay grades above my ""boss"". 

They also say that career mobility is something they encourage. In practice, getting in tough with internal hiring managers is laborious and conversations are often derailed by administrative interference.

To resolve this issue and to ensure all the competent highly paid workers were shown the door to make way for new and inexperienced people to come on board, Fidelity was able to save lots of $. This does happen with many compnaies, and finanical services was hit hard in the past few years. However, this started before that economic crisis.

They work you hard which is fine. Just don't expect to be fairly rated, and don't count on the bonus coming through.

Fidelity didn't innovate/realize early enough to understand the changing employer landscape which has cost it a lot of turnover.

There is no time in between calls and you’re pretty much hooked up to the computer all day. The metrics they want you to meet are almost impossible to follow so employees purposefully transfer calls to keep metrics low. My Manager criticized my calls so much at one point I realized there was nothing I could do to make him happy. Mistakes are to easy to make even if you are laser focused all day. I found a new position and was walked out after putting in my two week notice. They are paying me but i was unable to say goodbye to anyone so it looked like I was terminated after being walked out by my manager which wasn’t the case. Employees complained of being burned out constantly and management does nothing.

They were extreme micromanagers and very cliquey with each other.  They made it known who they favored and many deserving associates couldn't progress in their roles simply because they weren't favored.  You have to take your breaks and lunches at the exact times they schedule you for (which differed every day) and if you got stuck on a call and went on break late, it would negatively affect your numbers - which ultimately decided your bonus.  This place is a sweatshop.  You are expected to take non stop calls your entire shift.  There is no break in between calls so you aren't even left with time to make notes on the customers accounts you just spoke to - as soon as they hang up, another call immediately comes through with no choice to decline the call.  On average there is at least a 5-10 minute wait  for customers to get through to a representative.  Customers are already aggravated by the time you speak to them - it's like the company sets you up for failure.  They clearly need to hire more people for the role.  The turnover rate is so high because employees are so unhappy.  Glad I'm out of there.",13

If you are very good with Technology no one is likely to ask questions as they wouldn't want to reveal how little they know themselves.,Cons,"Fidelity is very political and top heavy.  Over 25% of IT people have titles of Director or above, however this is not because of ability, it is because it is the only way Fidelity can retain staff.  These people would not cut it at technology companies where engineering and merit are central.

In order to accomplish anything at Fidelity, you must have countless meeting with many groups of people, most of whom will not understand any technical aspects of the discussion.  Instead decision makers will rely on people with inflated titles whom they believe to be technical gurus, but who are simply the best at appearances and politics.

Fidelity is extremely title, appearance, and politics conscious.  Your actual ability to innovate, be creative, or lead is secondary to these factors.  If you are a true lover of technology who wants to learn and grow, then you should make every effort to join a proper technology company.  Avoid Fidelity at all costs.

The branch work environment is much different than the phone sites where customer service is provided to branch representatives and clients.

Overall, the only improvement to be made is in the compensation area and the technical development available to the representatives working at the branches.",Cons,Business platform is too large and departments are outsourced; created as phone sites versus subject matter support staff to advisors.

If you're looking to work on the most cutting edge technology or explore ways to disrupt industries, maybe it isn't the best place to work.  Although Fidelity focuses on innovation strategies and new markets, it's size means that change does not come quickly, for the most part, as there are many processes and controls wrapped around existing models.

It can be somewhat hard to distinguish yourself from your peers because there are so many analysts at the entry level.  Maybe it's typical for the corporate world, but it seems that most analysts get the same performance reviews.

When applying to a job at the same level the policy is that you cannot get a salary increase, even if the job is vastly different and within a different business unit.  Which means overall you are stuck at your current salary unless you look outside the firm",8

Management is hit-or-miss.  I worked for a couple of amazing, hands-on managers who were very engaged with their teams. I also worked for a few managers that appeared to do nothing other than sit around and play games on their phones all day.
A lot of push-back from different departments when you try to transfer calls.
Metrics are constantly changing.  What is important one quarter may be meaningless the next quarter.  It makes it very difficult to try to establish a routine on your calls when you don't know what measurements your bonus will be based on.
This is a call center job.  Don't try to kid yourself, you will be on the phones 8 hrs/day.  Unless you get a position in a branch, you will be on the phones, even if you are ""promoted"" to another role.",14

A Values Based Company that you can build a long term career with!,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW9131775.htm,5.0,"Jan 9, 2016",Senior Vice President,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Westlake, TX",Pros,"I am in my second decade with the firm and I am so happy I chose to work here out of college.

Family Owned:
This company takes care of its people.  I have been through 3 major economic downturns in my career and the firm always takes the long view and does cut into muscle and bone during trying times.  The Johnson family thinks in the here and now, but they also have a view 50 years out.  They are humble and grounded individuals that are always looking for opportunities to improve our business and our employee experience.  

Benefits:
We are industry leading, period.  Childcare assistance, tuition reimbursement, college loan repayment, healthy meals at a deeply discounted rate, onsite gyms, onsite healthcare facilities, onsite CFP programs, 6 months of leave for moms, computer purchase assistance, etc, etc, etc...  
If that wasn't enough, the firm isn't comfortable with out offering in this space.  We are in the midst of a major benefits reassessment.  Abby and her new head of HR are leading the charge in this effort.

Work Environment:
The family and the company goes to great length to ensure we have the best facilities for our teams.  Our major corporate campuses are spread across the country in beautiful locations.  While Fidelity is a conservative company, they build our buildings to last centuries and the are constantly refreshing them.  

I have read many posts about the call center environments.  I felt compelled to respond.  Call centers with any company are tough.  There is no way around it, it is a tough job.  However, it is an entry level position where you can learn a lot in and then leverage that learning to different roles in the future.  I know of 5 Executive Vice Presidents, several SVPs, and VPs who started in the same positions at the firm.  If you are coming out of college, you will likely start in an entry level position at some firm and you will have plenty of opportunities to work up and sideways from there.   

The firm could do a better job of facilitating that movement, but I will mention it further in the ""cons"" section.",Cons,"Career counseling: 
Many of us were told early in our career that you needed to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps when it comes to career planning. Essentially meaning, the cream will rise to the top, and the driven folks will figure it out. 

While there is merit in this strategy,it is outdated for the size of our company.  Like many companies of our size it can become difficult to navigate.  I feel that is why many of the comments on glassdoor related to this topic are correct from the perspective of the person writing the review.  However, this is absolutely not the intention of senior leadership.  The leadership team wants to hire college grads and watch them progress out of entry level positions and branch out throughout the business.  The individuals who do, are generally immensely successful.  

The problem lies in the lack of programmatic career planning conversations and marketing of the internal opportunities and job matching. To their credit, the firm has recognized this issue and I have heard is working on building career centers to help facilitate these dialogues and career plans.  I would expect comments related to issue to start to subside as this rolls out. 

To make a long story short, the sr. team has shown that they care and want to help find the solution.

HR systems and training:
Simply put, we have antiquated systems in HR, and training needs to be modernized to adapt to the way college grads learn.  A better mix of classroom training integrated with a lacking digital solution that ties to our HR systems. 

HR system and staffing:
HR needs an overhaul.  Specifically in staffing.  We have a very traditional model and staffing and HR are loaded with career HR and staffing people.  We need to take a cue from Silicon Valley companies and add more business consultants and business leaders to the HR function to modernize it.  We need to keep about a 1/3 of this business unit as traditional HR and Staffing consultants, but there is a serious lack of creativity and challenge of old processes because of the the similar backgrounds of everyone in the group.  Until we do, we are destined to be average in this space.",10

Benefits are very good. Pay is a little less at Fidelity but when you consider benefits in the compensation package it is competitive.

Workplace environment is reasonably professional and not stuffy.

For the most part front-line managers are willing to work with associates to find a favorable resolution to personal issues.

Managers don't throw you under the bus to customers just to make the customer feel better about a problem.

There are some great employees and managers who care about the customer and care about the employees.",Cons,"Middle and upper management appears to have no idea where they are trying to steer the company, so the company swings from taking an idea to the extreme to a complete 180. Today they may be focusing on customer satisfaction and personalizing the interaction and in a few months decide to strip down customer interactions to scripted nonsense.

There are very few outlets for good ideas to arrive at implementation. Although there are feedback channels that may from time to time result in small changes, the bigger process issues or customer/client issues are completely controlled from the top by people who don't understand (and at times take pride in not knowing) what they manage so they don't know how to recognize or fix problems. So something may be a problem for years before somebody decides to do something about it, and even then the ""solution"" may aggravate the problem.

Fidelity is very political. Fidelity is obsessed today with it's brand image to the public, but one thing that is always constant at Fidelity is the constant obsession about your ""brand"". Gossip is taken as gospel and can ruin your brand in a second. What people have to say about you will override your performance in virtually all cases. Many managers would rather sink one of their employee's opportunity for advancement to be able to keep that person's performance in their numbers. A lot of backstabbing and stealing credit occurs.

There's not a lot of advancement opportunity. When the economy was great in 2007 it wasn't that hard. If you were great in your job, you could move on to a slightly better position, and when you did well there, you could move to another slightly improved position, until you were where you wanted to be. Once the economy crashed in 2008 that all stopped. I get it. That happened everywhere. However, it also stopped all discussions of professional development and no effort was made to give opportunities to develop skills for the current role or another. As a result, future promotion will be very difficult because internal candidates won't be as competitive against external candidates.

Recruiting/HR and their processes are absurd. It can take months after applying for a position before you get an interview. You can apply for a role, not hear anything for several months, and then get an email that you have an interview the next day. So you end up with no opportunity to prepare and made no efforts to prepare because you never heard anything back. Feedback from interviews rarely exists or is very generic. Hiring managers are lazy and don't follow through. 

For every great manager there are ten clueless unhelpful managers. It's obvious that middle and upper management have no idea how to manage their people because there's very little accountability or responsibility on the part of front-line managers. Directors believe yelling at people is the only way to manage, so they will yell at their managers when the numbers are bad, and that's pretty much the extent of direction or vision executed at the management level. I have heard several managers complain that they don't feel it's right that their performance is judged based on the performance of the people they manage. Well, that's what managers are there to do. If they aren't managing towards success, then they aren't doing a great job. I understand there are low performers, etc. but when I see managers playing ping pong for hours in the break room, there's not a lot of accountability in the system.

There's a lot of infighting between different business units. Everybody points fingers but nobody takes ownership over problems and fixes them. Customers and employees get stuck in the middle with no way to get out.

Fidelity no longer places a premium on its talent. Since 2008 the company has eliminated whole business groups with no effort to keep around people with tenure with tremendous transferrable skills. It does very little to help grow talent or keep it from leaving. Where a few years ago employees were loyal to the company and that loyalty was returned, the company has completely eliminated that loyalty. As a result, the company keeps losing great talent and keeps hiring new people who underperform and embarass those of us who strive to be great at our jobs. 

While all of the above things are common among businesses and I have, as most people, experienced similar trends at other jobs, what I will point out is that these problems were not institutionalized in a company that performs with mediocrity and accepts laziness in its overall perforamce. Fidelity is a top competitior in its markets and a lot of its strength historically came from the loyalty to and from its employees. Fidelity has worked very hard to treat its employees with indifference and management -- from the very top -- has set the company afloat with no real vision or guidance other than keep trying to make things that don't work struggle to work.",17

Good brand recognition from customers, but this can turn into a negative if you lack humility.  Most reps are not as good as you think.  The green machine is doing a lot of the heavy lifting, but those who are good at building value and relationships can transfer those skills to an RIA and do really well.",Cons,"- Although micro-management is mentioned in almost every review, I think it stems from not trusting your veteran representatives.  Fidelity feels like they have to control people from the top, having branch managers regurgitate sentiments from the top.  This also leads to *bleep* rolling downhill.  Some managers did prove themselves as good salespeople, but eventually have to drink the Kool-Aid or they won't last long.  Either that or they give up because they can't change the system.  Other managers were opportunists who rose through the ranks quickly, moving fast enough before people can realize they aren't as good as they appeared.

- Compensation:  Yes, you can make very good money here, but if you're really good, you can make way more outside.  Compensation is figured out ahead of time and they reverse-engineer the compensation plan to get AE's back to target comp.  The last couple of years, they've reduced some of the pay, like basis points on new flows, coinciding with the S&P at historical highs.  Oddly enough, they had a reduction in force in 2009 because they based payroll on the S&P and had to cut people.  So when the market's down, you're screwed, and when the market's up, you're also screwed.  Ultimately, you can't keep lying about AE/SAEs being in relationship roles when your compensation is still based on selling products.  And this relationship model is 5 years old.",17

I have made several life-long friends and look forward to seeing them every day. Asking around you will find many people also found their significant others at work as well.

2 ~ Upward mobility and job opportunities. I may be biased from working at the Westlake campus where there are over 6000 jobs but it is also relatively easy to move to other locations within the company. There was a time years ago when it might have felt like you had to go to Boston to move up in the company but those days are gone and there are many great leadership positions throughout the country.

3 ~ Brand recognition you can be proud of and sleep well at night. Fidelity is a discount broker so not ripping people off with high loads or fees. They did not get caught up in the mischief so many other firms did with the mutual fund scandals or financial crisis.",Cons,"The best things about Fidelity are also the worst things about Fidelity. 

1 ~ If you end up in the wrong department with the wrong boss your life can be a living hell. Fidelity is very liberal in its HR policies which can be good but also means they let things fester for a long time before taking action. There is a percentage of people that will take advantage of this and especially if you are on a small team you may end up constantly covering for a weak link.

2 ~ It is an American dream to start in the mail room and work your way up to VP someday and that is totally possible at Fidelity. In fact, it may be a bit too easy. It is completely common to attend leadership meetings and hear from senior executives ""I started on the phones just like you!""  Well, that is fine once in a while but at some point you do want people leading you to actually have some training and experience. Fidelity is full of hundreds maybe thousands of Directors, VP's and SVP's that started on the phone ""just like you"" and it shows.

3 ~ Fidelity has managed to stay out of the news but there are plenty of unsavory things they do behind the scenes. They are currently very worried about the Department of Labor proposed Fiduciary Rule. Their current employer benefits business model is already unethical but if the rule is enacted will be illegal as well. It has long been a major IRA rollover sales lead source to take advantage of relationships with employers to gain access to employees. Fidelity is the world's largest 401k record-keeper and should this lead source be taken away it will be a huge hit to their personal investing sales model in which two thirds of the new assets are from internal rollovers. The Fidelity brokerage business would be nowhere near what it is today without having taken advantage of these workplace business relationships.",17

Generally speaking, upon completion of the program, financial representatives are capable of adequately performing the job duties in what is objectively a complicated job function without any sort of assistance. Also, barring a layoff climate or doing anything illegal, job security is very, very high; never hitting your numbers will still get you your weekly paycheck. If you play the game, opportunity is most certainly there to advance (and your manager will be first in line to assist you in achieving your goals), but you can only go so far in the call center, both in terms of job duties and salary.",Cons,"Unfortunately, the training program is where my positive experience ended. Employees are reminded every day from the first time they peruse the careers website, to the job interview, to on-boarding, to training, to team meetings, that Fidelity isn't like Merrill Lynch, Schwab, JP Morgan, or any other player in the game; Fidelity is a family-owned company and doesn't have to play to it's shareholders, and thus they are one of the few in the business ""for the customer"". That sure sounds nice, but beyond being family-owned, it's just not true. This job is in a 24/7 call center, and just like every call center in the world, metrics are king. You'll never move up anywhere in the company for retaining a multi-million dollar account or preventing perilous actions through education of financial instruments or any other morally outstanding action... you'll move up for finishing your calls on an average of less than eight minutes. This ""time = money"" focus exacerbates an already-beaurocratic business structure by incentivizing representatives to transfer their calls or to be curt to the point of being entirely unhelpful. That's fine, and almost expected from most call center representatives with other companies, but in financial services, it's unacceptable; you're dealing with people's retirement accounts and livelihoods. On the sales side, recommendations are limited to proprietary target-date funds and bloated, high-fee ""managed"" accounts. Going above and beyond to solve problems that are repeatedly surfacing and are consistently unaddressed is a habit discouraged by management: ""that's not your job"". Other than their own propaganda, nothing differentiates this company from the other financial services firms--do not take a potential paycut to choose Fidelity over them with the idea that you'll be working for some sort of Red Cross organization, even though they will spin it that way. At the end of the day, this is a 24/7 call center (where your job is to verify customers, reset passwords, give website support, send checks, and enter trades at their direction...financial professional is thrown around very loosely around Fidelity, but I would not consider the FR to be one) that is ALWAYS hiring. If you weren't able to deduce, there is an unhealthy amount of turnover at Fidelity due to employees leaving for increased responsibilities and salaries (most Jax representatives went to Merrill, which was literally across the street!). On the other hand, if you have some sort of relevant degree or experience and are out of work, there is a ton of job security and experience to be gained here. It's a stepping stone at best.",23

Solid training, cutting edge technology and likely the top benefits package in the industry. Brand recognition and commitment to marketing are also great advantages.",Cons,Fidelity tends to continually change the compensation plan for their reps and management teams. Very corporate culture which was always a bit heavy on conference calls and offsite meetings. Identity crisis at times in terms of promoting a sales versus customer satisfaction culture.

Depends where you are in your life,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW12369656.htm,3.0,"Oct 19, 2016",Vice President,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Smithfield, RI",Pros,Good benefits. Co-workers are nice. Work is super easy and doesn't take much time if you are smart. Great for coasting into retirement.,Cons,"Not a good place for people who are implied leaders. It's a very top-down culture. You have no budget even as a VP, no freedom to push outside the ""Fidelity way"". Most people have been here for the last 20 years and it shows how out of touch these leaders are with how workforce of today looks at leadership and work in general. Long tenured middle managers and individual contributors also show a strange indentured servitude behavior. Many don't have the spine to say the truth, stand up for their beliefs and do the right thing. The culture is to sugar coat bad news and push all decision making as far up as possible. 

This might be fine if you come from a top-down, command and control culture. If you have worked in a culture of empowerment, this will be a stifling place. 

The company is headed towards uncharted territory but people up top lack the will to get rid of the ""leadership"" crud that only knows status-quo and actively tries to stonewall new ideas. A vast majority started their careers in phone sales - so they are not equipped for todays and tomorrows world. It will be an extremely hard task to correct the current heading of this ship. Drastic measures are needed to clean house but I doubt it will happen. I am waiting to see what happens in the next year.

Again, if you are a young, go-getter this might not be a place for you.  If you want to build a career that enables you to work in another company later, don't count on developing yourself as a leader here. If you want to be told what to do and just want to spend a few more years until retirement, this place is great and has excellent benefits.",14

First, most of the ""design"" team doesn't come from a software design background (think ""first job after local graphic design agency"") — they have very strange, inefficient, and ingrained processes. Members of management are emotionally volatile, manipulative, and aggressive to the point of creating a truly unhealthy environment (something I wouldn't say lightly).

I love my teammates.,Cons,"They expect too much out of the employees. Certain months of the year overtime is mandatory, which they do not tell you when they hire you. If you get hired in through the call center it is nearly impossible to get a job off of the phones.

- Poor management is rampant and though there are annual manager effectiveness surveys nothing changes
- Pay is WELL below industry average for most positions so good talent is consistently walking out the door, leaving only terrible associates who managers refuse to fire in some groups",4

I also liked the number of community volunteer activities that you could choose from.",Cons,"It had become a bloated company with too many senior level people (a number without staff to manage).

Company stopped rewarding risk-takers years ago.  Attitude of most employees. is is to get what they can out of Fidelity because Fidelity is not going to do much for them.  Huge amounts of expertise were  let go (ie, senior subject matter experts, IT people) in past five years to reduce salary costs;  now is literally hard to find people who understand the business they work in.  Company communications to employees are of the rah-rah We are Great! sort.  Compensation levels are below industry standards.

This is a great thing, but also plays a big part in branch metrics, promotions, and availability. I have learned a lot and met some really fantastic people! The benefits package is top-notch!",Cons,"Upward mobility is limited by the size and availability of the next job up within the branches. If one were to consider moving to another branch, or geographic location entirely, then the availability greatly increases.

Decided to double the amount of people in my position in 2 months which is just reckless.  You are just another number to this company.  They do not value their employees or their clients.  The market manager told us to stop calling people in ""our book"" and only work with new clients.  Mandatory to have 18 appointments per week.

This job is mundane at the core.  Every single task is repetitive.  It is a constant stream of taking glorified service calls over and over, with the same requests again and again.  

There is very little outside opportunities, or work responsibilities.  

Managers are nothing but micro-managing and just want to see themselves go up the ladder.

The cafeteria is awesome and the building is beautiful. There is a reason for this.,Cons,The beauty covers the horrific harassment that is taking place in this company. There is a male manager that goes after women as his prey and tries to force them out of the company. The higher ups know about this and continually cover it up. I hope the owner reads this and goes to the Morrisville NC site to take a deeper look at all male managers. There are women managers that like to bully. This needs addressing as well.

-does not care for ability or knowledge, only that you meet your call metrics. There is a person on my team that has to call for help over 10 times a day, but no worries  because they take 50 calls. 
-job goes from remedial customer service work to having to explain complex investing and tax strategies.. no consistency in service. 
-management is all about the flavor of the day: for a couple of months it was having great conversations with clients, then it was all about having a good workplace to be in.. now it's about taking as many calls as humanely possible with no rest. 
-management likes to hype up the small things.. like wireless headsets, or taking a break when you want to... but they will pass a long all bad news to the lower level managers and will not face the front line reps at all. They refuse to hear any criticism on policy updates. Some are so far removed from helping any client that it's comical what they expect.
- lately they have been devaluing the high net worth service reps. They used to allow for casework and follow up on issues, but they've tossed that in favor of handling as many clients as possible. So now the client with 2 mill as equal standing as client with 2k. 
-management treats all reps the same, no matter fresh out the dorm room or seasoned worker. Can be frustrating..
-this is not a role to stay in for long. Go the sales route. Stay away from customer service. 
-refuse to be competitive in pay
- bonuses are a joke.. almost insulting

- Large enough company to move around in and chart a career path

- Pockets of great situations (good leadership, interesting work, challenging opportunities)",Cons,"- Those pockets of great situations are growing fewer and further between each day, the amount of influence one's boss can have on their career at Fidelity is astounding ... in 3 different jobs, I was rewarded (1) on par/average, (2) over-the-top with $$$ and shares and promotions, and (3) not at all .... my approach to the work didn't change in any of those jobs, so it shows that people of equal talent and skills could expect significantly different experiences at this company

 - Jobs are moving out of Boston, so local opportunities are few and far between ... those that pop up are usually pre-reserved for a hiring manager's friend (i.e. probably not the most qualified candidate), so the talent base is watering down, causing animosity, and those that want to advance their career in the Boston-area have to look elsewhere

- There is a layer of lifers at the Director / VP level that have settled into a comfort zone, earning high salaries from the days of raises/big bonuses (long gone), they are staying off the radar, and don't want to rock the boat ... so they are stifling innovation, they are roadblocks to progress, and they are blocking career opportunities for younger, talented, innovative staff members.

- Didn't get a raise in 3 years despite the company pulling in $2.2-2.4B in profit each year, was told it'd be made up to me in the form of a ""higher bonus"", but the bonuses were the same each year.

I can't pay rent, buy food, or pay all the other bills I have will my ""great benefits.""  Money is the only thing that helps with that - and the salaries Fidelity pays, compared to the broader industry, are ridiculously low.  Moreover, there have been numerous changes that have occurred in the last 12 months that are ostensibly to ""make things better"" for the customer, as well as the associate, but the net effect has been the opposite ... for both.  They've basically significantly increased the scope of the role, while narrowing the performance metrics ... all while creating an increasing environment where it essentially makes it impossible for you to provide the positive experience the customer is expecting, and meet your goals.  How this has played out out to associate is ... you can kiss making more than the bare minimum for your quarterly bonuses (which also ... in not very much at all) goodbye.  Also, over the last 12 months or so, there seems to have been a dramatic concern with turnover, primarily among the associates who have been with the company less than 12 months.  The company has become ridiculously preoccupied with finding ways to keep this demographic with the company that they're basically throwing everything but the kitchen sink at them in the misguided hope it will keep them from leaving.  Basically ... they're focusing all their measures on increasing salary, compensation, and quality at work to the employees who have been there the least, and contribute the least to the company's overall functionality.  I've been with the company, and in this function for years, and even though I've been given yearly bonuses and increases I sit next to people who have been licensed less than 6 months, and are making the same amount in salary as me, or more.  It's really insulting, not to mention makes all the experienced, and seasoned employees feel extremely unappreciated.  Then there's also the issue that performance and ability really have no bearing whatsoever towards promotions or recognition for achievement - the current situation at the location where I work reminds me more of my senior year of high school, and everything boils down to a popularity contest.  The end result is you have people who weren't even competent to begin with and routinely failed to meet even the most basic of their performance metrics, being given increased levels of responsibility and management if they're ""popular.""  Granted this exists to some degree or another no matter where you work, however the level I've witnessed over the years is on the order of 20 times worse than anything I've experienced in nearly 15+ years in the workforce.",10
Financial Adviser at Fidelity  = Churn and Burn,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW22493433.htm,3.0,"Sep 15, 2018",Anonymous Employee,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Washington, DC",Pros,"If you work hard and you are smart you can make an attractive income in the Financial Adviser (Consultant) role. Company benefits are fantastic. Fidelity has a very respected and recognized brand. Largest 401k provider in the US, provides amazing cross selling opportunities.",Cons,"There are many.

1) Financial Advisers have 300-1000 households to support and no real help to do so. The support staff is too inexperienced to do much more than help with some admin stuff and if they are good enough to actually help clients they move into a Financial Adviser role.

2) Your experience as an adviser can be made much worse by terrible managers who micro manage and have little knowledge of what you actually do.

3) Assuming 1 and 2 above, Financial Consultant role is too much of a grind to be a career. You either spend 2-5 years there and then move into management or you burn out and leave.

Advisers have 300-1000+ households and there is no meaningful compensation for retention of assets given the book sizes. ($40k year for a $200 mil managed money book? - book generates $1.5 - $2 mil annual revenue and you give the adviser $40k?)

Vast majority of your comp is tied to annual sales and what you have done in the past means nothing. Therefore clients that have a plan and 100% wallet share are undesirable.

Since company is so large and has so many clients they need to fill the chairs with advisers quickly. Many advisers are 20 and 30 somethings with little or no background in finance, they do the bare minimum for planning and only want to sell products and managed accounts. There is little incentive to really deliver a sound plan because that actually takes time and who has time with 1000 clients?

Overall - the reality is Fidelity is good for “mass affluent” financial help but they are too big and cookie cutter to truly help people with more than  $3-$5 mil. Due to size they have to reduce services to lowest common denominator to ensure consistency.",10

A Job to nowhere with a very low compensation at all levels,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW13858029.htm,2.0,"Feb 20, 2017",Fund Accounting Analyst,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Westlake, TX",Pros,"Mostly good honest people to work with. Diverse.
A good company for entry levels positions (but that's it).
Very nice and large campuses nationwide.
Can jump between departments if you want to make a change (but mostly horizontal movement that can last for years with no pay change)",Cons,"The fund a accounting group methodology of work is one big mess of excel spreadsheet macros with errors written by very few people at Fidelity and hold the knowledge and responsibility of why/what this job is about. The rest just push buttons and fake it. 
If you took 1-2 finance classes in college you will probably learn nothing new to help you in the industry. The monitoring and problem solving skills learned are 100% based on troubleshooting of departmental chaotic/confused processes of using excel and/or internal softwares. 
Managers don't (mostly) have any managerial skills or passion to manage and do so in order to climb the latter. In reality, they are analysts who stayed at Fidelity the longest (or when everybody else left after 2-3 years). 
Those who leave (which is almost all employees except managers) do so after realizing they will never be able to support an adult life/family with the low pay (including all ""unique benefits""). 

In conclusion, 
To demonstrate the shortsightedness and focus on internal computer troubleshooting I will use this fact: Most managers and directors can tell you a lot about how to find a variance due to miscalculation of an Excel's spreadsheet formula but no very little to nothing about the stock market, bond market, and most importantly the nature of mutual fund investing. 

After a while it becomes a very sad, and discouraging, work environment.
