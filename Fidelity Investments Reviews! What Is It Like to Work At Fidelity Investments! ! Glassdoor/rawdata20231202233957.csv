The breadth of this company provides a great opportunity to try out different career paths or boost your current one.,Cons,"In my current role, I am working overtime more often than I'd like with recognition that seems to only go so far until it sizzles out. That may be tied to the size of the company itself, where promotions work in a ""trickle down"" manner.",226

Or so I'm told honestly I don't understand why we don't have a single payer system it's insane that to have health care you need a stable job.  Don't even get me started on dental... What are they?  Luxury bones?,Cons,"Despite the fact that the average employee of this company can't even power on a computer my role is the lowest paid in the company.

To be clear the folks who work from home taking chats/calls who escalate their tickets to my team make more than my team. 

Let's talk numbers.

Inflation in 2021 was around 9% but the average raise for my team was 2%.

2022 was again around 9... But we got a whopping 7%.

That's a pay cut baby.  When we spoke to our leadership they literally told us to go find another job.

What's more is there is no out. You are trapped in this role forever or until you find something better elsewhere.  They offer programs to ""help you progress."" but then banish the techs because they don't want tech people. 

They also abuse the ever living crap out of contractors.  They want you as an employee handling people with millions of dollars in trades laptops but they don't wanna give health care.  Incredible.",3
Ehh...,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW82004455.htm,2.0,"Nov 21, 2023",Financial Customer Associate,Current Employee,"Durham, NC",Pros,The starting pay is pretty good for a call center. Great benefits as well.,Cons,"They claim that there are so many different opportunities to grow within the company, but make it impossible to explore those options due to working a strict schedule on the phones. The call volume is back to back with no room to breathe in between calls. You go through 3 months of training and still feel confused at the end. They encourage you to ask questions and reach out for help, but when you reach out for help, you're reprimanded for doing so. You have no say so in your schedule and you have to work between 12pm-8pm so say goodbye to having any type of social life. They offer free therapy and after working there for about a week, you'll quickly understand why.",3
Let Go While 7 Months Pregnant,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW80985681.htm,1.0,"Oct 16, 2023",Financial Consultant I,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Chicago, IL",Pros,I was drawn to the training program for the Financial Consultant role. Good 401k match.,Cons,"I was in a 1 year training program for the Financial Consultant role while completing my CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ certification. I was told I needed to sell more insurance, annuities, and managed accounts in order to continue on as a Financial Consultant. I was let go as soon as I hit the 1 year mark, shortly after I became a CFP® professional. I had told HR that I was pregnant when I became concerned about losing my job and asked to be considered for a different role within Fidelity (since I knew I would not be able to interview and start another job at 7 months pregnant). After I was let go by my manager, I reached back out to HR and they were not even aware that my employment was being terminated. Everyone I dealt with at Fidelity was extremely insensitive to the fact that this would cause a huge amount of stress to me and my family at a time that stress had serious potential health risks to myself and my baby. I ended up being unemployed for close to 9 months. I was interviewing for new jobs while also taking care of a newborn and paying extremely high premiums for health insurance for my family. Only 23% of CFP professionals are women, and only about 15% of financial advisors are women. Even though Fidelity touts its family values and culture, I would not recommend Fidelity to women based on my experience.",18

The onboarding managers openly compare you to others, bring up personal things in 1 on 1s about other associates and make comments about your life like suggesting you should be married or have children by now. They yell at you on the floor in front of the entire facility if you do something they don't like. The don't advocate for people who have disabilities when it comes to learning the material so you're constantly compared to others openly. They require you to work multiple hours a week UNPAID after your schedule and on weekends. They SUGGEST you should work through your breaks and lunches.",2

These can be challenging to balance at times, but they do their best and are mostly successful at it. Flexible work schedules is primary reason Fidelity is retaining a lot of their talent. It's for these reasons I've been with the company almost 20 years and plan to retire here if possible.",Cons,"Lately the company has been getting a little political and pushing some activist type initiatives, which doesn't sit well with many employees. They of course won't speak up and say much, especially ones who've been around a while. The company needs to stick to financial matters and stay away from woke agendas or they may face backlash even if their intentions are sound.",2

Career opportunities are ongoing and the vast majority of people at the firm will help you progress if you're willing to do the work.
Fidelity provides exceptional benefits with options based on personal needs and various family situations.

Their 401k match and profit sharing is impressive. Great starting place for a career. Career mobility is available yet there can be ceilings for advancement. Their products and platform solutions are also quite good. Truly a client centric organization and is focused on maintaining that perception. Their approach during Covid was pretty level-headed.,Cons,"Consistent theme where senior mgmt proved to be disinterested and detached from the happenings on the ground. In retrospect, there is also an unhealthy fear within the workforce. There was always a worry about a rumored layoff and then those that always make a point to ‘appear busy.’ Often you will hear from peers or managers that the grass isn’t always greener or that you should think twice before leaving. Other comments regarding excessive workload expectations and having a stressful work environment are also understated. That is pretty consistent across the channels.",3

Secondly, Fidelity places a strong emphasis on professional development, offering numerous opportunities for career growth and skill enhancement.

They also have a ""Fidelity Made"" program for people interested in tech.",Cons,"Upper leadership doesn't listen to employees. Every quarter, they require employees to come into the office more and more, and they took away the free meal on top of that. So you end up spending a lot of money going to work.

Gone is the autonomy and flexibility as ""Big Brother"" started watching your every badge swipe. Go ahead take PTO during a Connect Week, but be prepared to have to make those days up in the office. The required in-office attendance wasn't really helping with collaboration, associates kept earbuds in and to themselves anyway and still attended all meetings virtually.

Coworkers are always very friendly and wonderfully supportive.",Cons,"Management, especially at the WI VP level lately, has begun to treat strangle its workforce. It is courting the 401k 403B business to the last penny and is willing to sacrifice its associates well-being. Any problem that occurs is blamed on the lowest on the pole. Lots of monitoring of our movement (92% has to be at the desk of your day) and very little time to learn or move up. Managers on a whole are good people but have no power to help. Lower managers also tend to favor the people they manage on site for promotions.",6

CRA role: read this first!,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW80500091.htm,4.0,"Sep 28, 2023",Customer Relationship Advocate,Former Employee,"Merrimack, NH",Pros,"1.) About 20 PTO days, benefits, lots of perks like a concierge you can call to help with anything. 2.) My managers were very good at communicating and looking out for my mental health. I was going through licensing for a call center role and was getting a little burnt out. One of my managers even had a real talk with me about how hard the role was and supported my decision to leave the company. The managers are the real gems.",Cons,"1.) Fidelity requires associates to be in one week every month. Though it was nice to work from home most of the time, the in office week was required and NOT flexible. Sometimes I had to use my PTO days because I was sick and couldn't make it to the office. I would rather be in the office any 5 days of my choosing. 2.) Licensing is hard. Many people left because they couldn't pass the tests (including me). I was in training long enough to see what my role looked like after licensing and it only gets harder. 2.) If you're in the CRA role, please read this first. Do you really want to stay in a job where it's just one call after the other, no idea what it's going to be about, no idea if the client is going to scream at you, and thrown into it without any real training? Fidelity training is very long but does not go over every scenario there is; they expect you to know 100 things while doing something as simple as phone calls. Most of them were password resets or transfers to branches and while most clients were very pleasant, there were some that were outright abusive. I don't blame them as it's managing their money but some could ruin your day. I would not doubt it if my role was completely taken over by AI in a few years. Licensing was fine but once you get to the job it is very overwhelming and exhausting. I knew some coworkers who said that it was very stressful learning so much while also not knowing everything. There just isn't enough time fit everything in your schedule. This was what my day was like when taking calls for two weeks: - 8am: 30 minute team meeting (sometimes this was at 4:30 depending on schedule) - 8:30am: start calls for the day - 10:30am: take 15 min break - 12pm: break for lunch - 1pm: start calls again - 3:30pm: take 30 minute break - 5pm: end day I could take a 45 min break which is measured to the minute while lunch after training is only a half hour. Your whole day will just be phone calls. On my worst day I took about 40 but I've known people who took 60. Even just two days on the phones burnt me out so much.",7

Good training for fundamental concepts but once this is established not a place for creative concepts and independent thinking. Management wants you to ask same questions and run same exact process on every single client regardless of situation.,Cons,"Middle management doesn’t care about clients and relationships. This is strictly a sales role and very minimally a planning role. I think if upper management knew how investor centers were being run and how churning clients and quick selling was being pushed they would be disturbed. Clients usually sell out of managed money within 5 years bc they were falsely sold, they’ve had advisor turnover once or twice in that timeframe, and managed accounts underperform their own asset manager funds. If you want a real financial planning career go to an RIA after 1-2 years in this role",13

As a team leader it felt like there were still 17 levels of people above me communicating decisions, and there was a real disconnect between the front-line and the very top on what was needed and wanted. Pay was decent, but HR makes it about impossible to negotiate numbers or get pay bumps off-cycle.

I worked 4x10 M, W, F, Sa from 12:30 - 11pm.

The expectation for hourly roles is: you clock in on the dot and punch out on the dot without pressure to work extra. They respect your boundaries in this way which is appreciated. The way licensing was structured was nice, you study 90% of the week then come in for a half a day of phones to keep those skills somewhat ready for when you pass. Overall if you’re a recent college grad or looking to make a career transition from another industry this isn’t a bad place to be, you’ll likely get an offer because they have a lot of seats to fill and a decent amount of turnover at the 1-2 year mark.",Cons,"I have worked in other industries and other large corporations before coming to Fidelity, if you’re new to the workforce or new to working for a decent large corp this experience may seem amazing but it’s mostly external and internal marketing driving that narrative. Most of the 5 star reviews for this role specifically must be from somewhat naive folks or folks that can’t see through the “lifestyle” aspects of the culture and can’t see it for what it really is. The recruiter described the training program as “world class” explaining it would be this 8 month process where you’d emerge out the other side a “financial professional”. You certainly learn a lot but most of us who finished the entire program still feel like we don’t know much, it seemed like an long-winded waste of time, Mgmt seems content with the quality of the reps that exit training and Fidelity certainly seems to overpromise and under-deliver on the onboarding side of things but that’s typical for a large corp. Their goal with training is, in their words “pace over perfection” I can’t imagine touting my reps as remotely competent or being a reputable company when the rep answering the phone doesn’t really know what they’re doing. You should change your objective to: “profits over proficiency”. The job is answering 30-40 calls per day, some good some are bad but it’s definitely more customer service orientated, your most prevalent inbound demographics for this role are the elderly, and rude clueless people that can’t do simple transactions on the website. Pay is bad, 23 an hour start, 24 after that, quarterly target is 800.00 and if you exceed the benchmark, which can be challenging with the callers you get (hour long password resets/account management are fairly common and kill your stats) you can be eligible for year end bonus. 51-54k total comp in a metro area is a tight budget to live on.",5

The communication. The job description and entails do not match up. Bullying and abuse of power. Demand does not equal appropriate pay. You have an obscene workload. Calls are timed and scored. In training it was a lot of making fun of people for incorrect answers. You do an invasive and demanding background check for a pay and benefits you can get at basic companies. Diversity is next to none but in my class there where 3 people outside of white 2 of them where already with the company and was switch departments. I would I have recommended this for someone just starting their career but the intense background, drug screening you have to fill 3 cups up. Demand and low pay is not worth it.

Raises are only given for good performance if HR decides that it is merited for that year. It’s very ambiguous and leaves many employees feeling sour. Raises are usually only given from promotions, which keeps people trapped in mid tier pay despite hard work and dedication.

I asked numerous times if I could get guidance on moving to other business units and was basically told it’s all about metrics and that there is no alternative. However, even when you meet the ridiculous metrics in a month, it might be that the growth skill you wanted is not even hiring. So it’s like an endless cycle of MAYBE next month, IF you hit the metrics again. I definitely feel like there is a double standard for certain people.

They know their stuff. Especially retirement help desk,Cons,"They promote based on calls per hour now. They call them ""automatic promotions"". Basically, people prove that they're good at a job by how short their calls are (even if they're providing inaccurate information during that short time). Managers don't even recognize inaccurate information because they're not specialized on a specific function (ex. Retirement, high net worth, stock plan services, etc.) HR does not care about what an employee has gone through with a specific manager. They always take the manager's side, unless the employee makes a bigger deal about it constantly. The system they use to measure ""calls per hour"" is extremely flawed. It glitches people out of their status codes, which causes their CPH to go down. Management is aware of it, but does not take responsibility. They'll tell the employee to directly connect to their router, and that will minimize the disruptions. This is their solution, rather than changing the way CPH is calculated, or simply making CPH an insignificant measurement. Bonuses for the little guys may or may not come. You also might get scammed out of it by some loophole they find. For instance, they had a tax incentive going on that had an ""attendance kicker"" which meant you couldn't have any ""same day PTO""... however, even for people who scheduled PTO months in advance, because some of it landed on a Friday or Monday, the system counted it as ""same day PTO"" , so those people didn't get the ""attendance kicker"" for that month.",4

Many of the perks are geared toward a younger workforce so if you have student loans and want to continue your education, you will be served well by Fidelity's benefits.",Cons,Entry level jobs are not a livable wage given the skyrocketing costs of housing and food in the Salt Lake area. It takes many grade levels of promotion to make much more than entry level pay. Luckily the benefits help make up for some of that but some people just need to be able to pay rent and eat as a priority to being fully vested after 5 years of service. Fidelity is growing at a very rapid pace and with all the diversity and inclusion initiatives it's leaving some groups without certain rights. There are no longer safe spaces for women to be able to deal with bodily functions in safety and privacy. The culture is so inclusive and refreshing but over the top which has also created a level of toxicity where some do not dare advocate for themselves without fear of backlash. Hearing the whispers of dissatisfaction over some of this makes for a fairly stressful environment and might be sewing deep seated seeds of division. There has to be a way to dance the diversity and inclusion dance without excluding wide swaths of the population.,1

As a recruiter- I can do my work remotely and it's been inconvenient driving to the office which means less productivity time to do my work. There shouldn't a strict schedule to follow.

You often work alongside midlevel managers to executives at every level and you are appreciated for your contributions no matter what level of tenure or seniority you have.

It goes without saying that you get out what you put in, so you likely won't experience the following cons as long as you are actively growing/learning new skills and networking/volunteering with groups for new opportunities.

-Base pay can be a little low, especially in your first couple years if you're not actively seeking new opportunities to learn new skills, network, or take on side projects. 
-Annual pay increases are small for a profitable company. To realize a significant jump in pay, you need to actively seek a promotion or jump laterally to another team or business unit.

Then ""dynamic"" working started, where they forced employees to come to the office for 3 days a month, in the same week that they scheduled. Then a day or two after they closed the employee satisfaction survey, they announced that they were increasing that significantly starting in January. Suspicious timing to say the least. Why the need to go to the office? Remote working increased employee productivity. There is no need for all positions to be in the office. Yes, they have an exception process, but those approvals are far and few between, and do not cover all employee issues.

- good resume builder if you need to help build it

- Stats; you have to meet call criteria which some is understandable but then you have situations that they don’t train you on and your stuck ruining your stats. 
- You feel like a robot and are really just a number. Saying the same things over and over to every customer can get tiring especially some of them are super rude and impatient.

I didn't have a consistent break schedule, and I found it difficult to eat on demand. I don't deal well with toxic people, so it was a very stressful job. I also felt completely drained most days. Since there are so many clients and each have its own rules/policies, it felt like I took a 8-hour test most days. Most of the time I used my breaks to meditate from customers. But if you can handle that. This won't be an issue. My biggest issue was the software time management that tracked every second of your time. I found that really stressful.

It’s values are based in the idea of helping people, by empowering everyday people to grow their savings and making investing more accessible. Care for employees is also a major focus and it shows in the benefits and pay practices. Many people stay for a long time because they relate to those values and the people are great as a result. Our CEO (Abigail Johnson) is awesome - she pushes her leaders to be on the cutting edge of research and employee practices, and prioritizes modernizing the company. The company isn’t afraid to invest in hiring and projects at times when other firms are contracting, but is responsible and prudent in running the business. Although there is room to continue improving in DE&I, the priority is clear and actually being lived out. Personal growth and risk taking is rewarded in one’s career, and test-and-learn / agile / scrum methods are common in many areas of the business. I’m extremely proud to work here.",Cons,"Because everyone is so values-driven and the company is growing, it is easy to burn yourself out - there are always opportunities to grow and contribute. Leaders are sensitive to this and it’s starting to change (eg some leaders demonstrate more ability to prioritize or set boundaries), but the onus is still on each employee to manage. The upside is that this is a symptom of the company’s growth and hiring - a much better problem than the alternative.

One could only imagine how distraught I was to learn that I had lost it all because of the exam. I gave my all every single day and showed up on site despite the three day per month minimum requirement. I feel as though I tried and succeeded, to the best of my ability, to make a positive mark on the faces I saw at the workplace and put my best foot forward at this transitionary time in my personal life as well. This opportunity was a way out of a lot of troubling situations for me. I write this review, hence, to highlight the important truth and current state of mind I possess with respect to my former employer, for whom I have zero resentment or reason to ever say anything negative about Fidelity whatsoever. It was the greatest opportunity in the near dozen jobs I have listed on my resume, and kickstarted a career in the securities industry by inspiring me to re-register for the FINRA exams all by myself again. To everyone that gave me an opportunity at this incredible firm I say thank you, and with the experience I've gained and things I've learned, I will not still be at this company by the time I retire, but somewhere beyond the stars instead, as this setback has given me an opportunity - just like Fidelity did - to dream big in my career with a vow for hard work. #Fidelityassociate",Cons,"Like I said, no cons at all!",1

Most marketing teams here are treated like red headed step children, lacking tools & resources to achieve the most basic marketing objectives. It’s like stepping back into 1999. Don’t get me wrong - there are many really smart marketers within the company who know how and want to do the right things….but are blocked at almost every turn. This comes straight from the executive level - the people running the show clearly don’t get how impactful a funded, motivated, technically advanced marketing team can be. Especially interesting given the company is very intent on engaging the next-gen to fill their long term pipeline - not sure how they think they are going to get them without smart, data-driven marketing programs and the technology that supports.",4

They invest in cloud technologies like AWS and modern web tools like Angular, Node, etc. They even give you 1 day out of every 10 as a ""Learning Day"" to stay up-to-date or broaden your skills. Pay is competitive, and they gave an ""extra bonus"" last year beyond the normal profit-sharing, just because the company had done so well. Work-life balance is encouraged and respected, and PTO is generous. Most of all, I have no concerns about job security in uncertain times!",Cons,"They are a big company. Working for a small startup might be more exciting and adventurous (though some projects within Fidelity have that ""startup spirit""). There's some inertia and levels of bureaucracy if you want to change a process or procedure. The huge size of the company means that you can have a totally different experience on a different project or division of the company.",

I was told that everything needs to be perfect. The job that they advertised was nothing compared to what you have to deal with. Training is 11 weeks long and you read and watch videos. There are no dummy accounts so you can't practice unless it's on a live account. You really can't move up in a position unless you've been in your current one for 2 years. Our lunches are only 30 mins and granted you get 2 15 min breaks but its hard to unwind mentally on just 30 mins. If a customer writes a bad review on you whether it was the customer's fault it's on you. Also, we were just told in training that if we ask a team for help with a question and they give us the wrong answer and we tell the customer the answer, it's our fault.

Some folks are driving an hour one-way to sit in an office where no one on their team works which means they drive into an office to still attend meetings on Zoom. Makes no sense!

For peak weeks (high call volume weeks) you get a $200 incentive. There’s a $1000 bonus ($700 after taxes) for finishing training and another one after 6 months. There’s about 3 or so weeks of PTO and you can take voluntary unpaid time off too.,Cons,"They require everyone to come on site 5 consecutive days each month when your job can be done better at home. Imagine a room full of phone associates all talking at the same time. Not great for the customer service experience. They love talking about how they support work life balance, but ignore the fact the a lot of employees have to add 2 hours of driving time when going to the office. The 7% 401(k) match doesn’t start until a year after working here and even then you have to wait 3 more years to be vested. A lot of the stats they use to measure call success are not realistic. You can have 90% schedule adherence but if your wrap/idle time is too high (time you use to log calls or use the restroom) then they’ll focus on that. The surveys participants fill out can leave you a positive note, but they’ll label it as “Vague” If a call is transferred and the participant has a bad experience with the second person and fills out a survey, the survey reflects on you because you answered the phone first. Genesis (the system we use for taking calls) has a lot of problems with Mis- transferring calls which causes participants to have a bad experience which makes our jobs harder and our survey scores lower. The technology we use is VERY outdated. We have 2 different systems for doing rollovers/withdrawals. Depending on the type of transaction you’re doing determines which system you use.

During a shift bid, I was one of the top performers who bid for a shift. I didn't receive the shift, when I asked about it and compared my performance to coworkers management said they'd get back to me. They then advised they'd made a mistake, but that they wouldn't correct it. We eventually found a compromise where I worked a different shift, but it was very disconcerting that I was told they'd made a mistake and then I had to push to get them to not simply say ""Too bad"". 

We also had a member of our team who practiced textbook ""Call avoidance"" where they would simply sit there and avoid calls forcing more burden on the team. When confronted, the employee admitted to it, but was given another chance. I knew of other employees who were let go for lesser offenses, so there were inconsistent standards at times. 

At the time I left, I had a new manager of approximately a month, and the senior manager spent the entire interview asking me about that manager and how they worked. I let the manager know that she seemed to have some sort of personal vendetta, she fired him shortly after.",1

It's an indication of how absolutely oblivious upper management is to the situation on the ground. 1. Heavy volume of calls- there is NO pause between calls on many days. It's ridiculous to expect people to provide excellent customer service for an eight or ten hour shift when the volume is that heavy. 2. You will be micro-managed. Even if you're intelligent enough to make decisions that are best for the customer, you'll be told to do it according to the protocol, which a good deal of the time doesn't make any sense. 3. You will feel like a robot. You have to follow Fidelity's robotic call structure; miss any element of that and an excellent call becomes 'satisfactory' according to the judgement of ""Quality,"" the Big Brother of Fidelity who evaluate calls. It is EXTREMELY demoralizing to feel like you have done an amazing job and that customers were happy with your service, but Fidelity is going to find a thousand things to criticize you on. 4. You are expected to know (or know how to locate) massive amounts of information. You will be asked obscure questions, and you'll have to sort through electronic encyclopedias of financial information to attempt to find the answer. 5. Customers get screwed over all the time. Somebody taking a $150 payout from their 401K has to pay the same $25 withdrawal fee as someone who's taking out $100K. Want tracking with your rollover check (Fidelity doesn't do direct rollovers)? You're going to pay $25 for that too. There are ""recordkeeping fees"" on most 401Ks. It's a racket.",6

Fidelity MADE is a SCAM!,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW73415449.htm,1.0,"Feb 7, 2023",Customer Relationship Advocate,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Durham, NC",Pros,"Decent PTO- you are going to need it, you will be burnt-out, I have had jobs with half the amount of PTO and not used all of it, I used every single day at Fidelity Paid Training and Licensing- They pay for your licenses and the time it takes to train for them, many people freak out during licensing and say how difficult it is, I found the time to be pretty good, you have most of the day to yourself to study with the materials they provide and then fill in the gaps with Zoom meetings, pretty different experience from when you get on the phones and are glued to your workstation because you never know when the phone will ring. Overall the exams are hard but I passed on the first attempt for each of them and didn't study a minute when I wasn't getting paid to do so. Having said that if you are having a difficult time with the material it may be a different story for you, also you will lose many co-workers during this time since they cant pass the exams. Our team was lucky and only lost a few but others had close to the whole team fail. If you can't pass the exams they often offer you a job with the 401k team but it is for lower pay and much higher call volume. Managers- Your experience may vary but every manager I had was very helpful and easy to approach Coworkers- Once again your experience may vary but I have had several teams in my time with Fidelity and they were mostly all good to work with Campus- This depends on your regional site but Durham has a very nice campus, with on-site cafeteria, albeit mediocre food, walking trail, very nicely equipped gym, Starbucks and ping pong and cornhole. In Durham's case it has some amenities you might expect from a tech site and that is because much of Fidelity's tech is centered in Durham, I have heard from co-workers in other sites that their campus is not nearly as nice and that probably has to do with the fact that non-tech at Fidelity are treated like second class citizens. Also you know what has many of those amenities, my house, so maybe don't force your coworkers to drive in so they can do the same thing they would have done at home but in an office, where it is louder and harder to hear clients Slow Season -During the summer months call volume slows dramatically and you may only take a handful of calls all day. It's not as great as it sounds though because you sit in ready for over an hour sometimes and you never know when you actually will get a call so you are stuck near your desk and if you have to go to the bathroom or get up for a minute you have go into not ready, do that too much and they are going to say you are avoiding calls and it will affect your metrics. Decent amount of off phone time when it is slow. - Not much to add to this one Benefits- This is the number one reason that anyone works for Fidelity, for the ""amazing"" benefits. While the benefits seem amazing at first, if you dig a little deeper they lose a lot of their luster. For example, the incredible match is only offered after your first full year with the company, in the meantime you get nothing and it takes a full five years to vest. The healthcare is pretty good but you are going to probably need it to go on anxiety medication, other benefits sound good but have pretty limited use, such as adoption assistance, commuter assistance that does not cover gas or vehicle payments but things such as public transportation, I don't know a single co-worker who used the bus to get to work nor if there was even one around and lastly, health reimbursement which sounds great but can only be used for classes and not equipment, so it covers Jazzercise but not weights or a treadmill. One benefit that was really great was student loan payments, which only knock on that was it was limited to 2k a year for up to 5 years. Overall the benefits are still really good, however Fidelity is run by smart people and they crunched the numbers and offering these benefits are cheaper than raising base pay.",Cons,"This first part only applies to those interested in getting into tech, so skip ahead if that is not you. Fidelity offers a non-tech to tech training program called Fidelity MADE, which sounds nice on paper and lures many to the company, however it is poorly run and if you do not check the right diversity boxes, you have no chance. It does not matter if you have a bachelors in computer science from a major state university, previous experience with the technologies they use, if you have had previous technical internships, if you have gotten a 100 on your first attempt on the pre-test, none of it matters because the number one thing they care about is satisfying a diversity requirement. Even the recruiter in charge complained that those running the program made them interview everyone that applied regardless of their qualifications and it set them back heavily. Ultimately it took them three and half months to send out rejection letters, a full month behind their schedule. When you get rejected its just a canned rejection letter that tells you to apply next time and continue practicing your technical skills, which is a joke because the interviews barely touch on anything technical and just a bunch of fluff, tell me about a time questions over and over, I suspect they did this so they could justify hiring blatantly under qualified individuals. This was not just me but several candidates with similar qualifications, the only similarity, our demographic. I wasted a full year before I could apply to MADE, practiced with the technologies in my free time and did everything I could do to prepare but it all was for nothing. If you want to break into tech this is not the way to do it. Future of work - They act like they are geniuses for coming up with the concept of hybrid work. There is no reason to have to go into the office when we worked perfectly fine remotely for over a year, but the billionaire boomer CEO thinks it is a great idea. At first it started as just three days every four weeks but then became five days every four weeks. I suspect they are going to go one week on and one week remote in the future but probably want to wait till after tax season so they can stomach the loss of staff better. The worst part about hybrid work is all the people who are only pay grades 1 or 2 can't generally afford to live near campus, so they have to drive, many well over an hour each way without traffic but all the higher ups do not have a problem with it because they get paid enough to afford decent housing near campus. Pay - The pay is mediocre and below industry standard. It is widely talked about how you can go to any competitor in the industry and make more money but the managers have to remind you how great the benefits are. I went up a pay grade and got to cost of living adjustments during my tenure and I barely noticed a difference. Schedule- Like working 8-5, well too bad because after training you will be moved to shift bid. You will be lucky to get anything before your 5th choice. The shifts start as early as 5am and go as late as 11pm so it is more than likely you will end up working odd hours. Tech Support - Fidelity's internal tech team is almost impossible to reach and it can take up to an hour to reach them, the digital tools that you have can be pretty hit or miss and some of them will just stop working randomly, so it would be great to be able to reach them. Also they are incompetent, when you leave the company make sure to get a receipt for your returned equipment because they will be hounding you to return it even though you already did. Client Obsessed - The company likes to say how client obsessed they are but I found this a joke. Very rarely does anyone at the company actually go above and beyond for the client, they mostly just tell you to let the client know you can't do something. Most of the people at the company are too worried about covering their butt rather than actually doing the right thing. Also it does not matter how great you are with the clients and how great your client survey scores are because how do you get promoted? By having enough calls per hour and if you are even a little under that, you are not getting promoted. You are incentivized to get the client off the phone as quickly as possible and if they don't complain it is good enough. Also I love how they say how client obsessed they are but this is the same company that is actively discouraging the use of mail in favor of digital, the clients who stuck with the company for a half century and helped build it into the billion dollar juggernaut today might not want to use a computer and they should not have to go through a lot of hopes to do so. It really won't even be a problem in about a decade since most of the clients that really care about the mail are in their twilight years. Promotions - The promotions are a joke when it comes to pay, you might get like a 5% bump in pay and a chance to make some more in bonuses. Also for auto promotions they only hire in certain departments randomly so if there is a department you want you will have to keep qualifying for them every single month and hope they are hiring that month and also hope you don't get a trade error because then you are disqualified for that month. Most people just take the first department they are offered rather than going through that. Any off phone openings are crazy competitive, they may have two spots open and get over 60 applicants because most people hate their phone role, so if you want off the phone good luck. Tax Season - During tax season, Feb-April you will be non stop busy and as soon as you hang up the phone another one comes in. I have worked in a restaurant for a long time and I was more physically exhausted after this job during the busy season than an active job like that. After spending all day talking to clients you just want to just sit there and do nothing and not talk to anyone, it is the most emotional and mentally draining time. Anxiety- Almost all your co-workers will talk about how much anxiety they feel all the time. This is not during the first few weeks either, we are talking about people who had been there for well over a year. The Sunday Scaries are real and you will probably get them bad. I ended up having to go on prescription medicine to help manage my anxiety and only got off as soon as I left the job. FINRA regulations - This one is not about Fidelity in particular but about the industry as a whole, FINRA regulations are very strict and require you to give a lot of personal information and limit outside business activities and amount of trading you can do in a quarter. Onboarding - The onboarding process takes forever with Fidelity and is pretty messy. The recruiter told me I had to get drug tested within a couple days but the place they wanted me to use was appointment only and did not have any openings during that time frame. Luckily they were able to reschedule but it was very inconvenient to have to panic that I wasn't going to have a job because I could not get the drug test done in time. Recruiters- Some recruiters straight up lie about the job and what it entails, one of them told my coworker that they mostly would be answering emails. The truth is it is a call center and we are not even able to email clients. How the job is advertised - Fidelity makes a big deal of being a financial professional and how you are going to have a series 7 job. The truth is it is a call center and you are going to feel like you work in retail more than working in finance, especially because you are going to be working retail hours most likely after you are done with training. There is a reason most of the people they hire have no financial background and come from retail jobs. The job itself - All this and I never even mentioned what the actual job is like , the truth is it is torture. One co-worker said it best when he said this job should be banned by the Genova convention, not only did I agree, I used those exact words to describe it to other people before. Surprisingly the clients themselves are not too bad and you even get some pretty pleasant and grateful clients but the job is a grind. Not only is everything you do monitored and recorded, it makes it difficult because you never know when the next call is going to come in. The best way to describe the job is like helping your grandma with her online banking details over the phone all day every day. Many of the people are technologically illiterate and almost everything has to be done on their end digitally. The simplest tasks like password resets and adding banking details can easily take over 40 minutes and wreck your stats. Also if you have to reach out to other departments many times they don't want to take the call from you or it can take a very long time to reach them. I have had to wait over an hour for the fraud department to fix simple issues, obviously the client is mad when you get back and the whole time your stats get destroyed. Many departments like fraud and transition services are chronically understaffed and as soon as you get a call that needs them you know you are not going to have a good time. As the client facing member of the team you are going to have to break a lot of bad news and hear some pretty tough situations. If you like waiting on hold and calling your bank's customer service, this is the job for you. Miscellaneous - The same time they required people to go into the office, they canceled the $10 lunch credit, I don't expect to get free food but the food was only worth it if it was free and I thought it was classless to cancel it at the same time as forcing people into the office more. Also no money for bonuses but a few days later we find out they are going to give a quarter billion dollars to underserved students. They virtue signal about diversity but the tech department is the least diverse place that I have ever seen. Wrap Up - Ask yourself why a company that has such ""great"" benefits, that brags about being voted a top place to work, has to spend so much on recruitment ads. The truth is it is a low paying call center and for every success story you see, there are dozens that washed out.",11

It's not terrible, but you're tied to the phones for 8 hours everyday, minus any trainings you're subject to. That is the job we signed up for, but once you're actually doing it full-time, you'll start to hate it. At least I did. You get nice people sometimes, but the participants (people calling in) can be really entitled and annoying. It also seems like everyone is just as confused as you are. They preach about how the F in Fidelity is for flexibility, but it can quickly turn into organized chaos. Most of my training class is still confused about a lot of things when it comes to bonuses, PTO, etc. During training, they'll bring a ton of people in and host panels full of people that preach how awesome Fidelity is. They're not lying per say, but take it with a grain of salt. Go your own path and figure out if it's right for you. The CEO is also trying to make people come in 5 days out of the month (we do 3 currently) starting in January, and they only plan to increase the amount as we go through 2023 and onwards. She's getting a lot of pushback on it because going into the office is draining and a waste of time, since most of us can work more efficiently in our role at home.

Feeling regret after taking this new job. You have to essentially sell your soul to work here, you have to hand over all your financial accounts and there are so many restrictions and requirements with what you can do from your accounts down to outside activity, to social media, and even access to your personal devices if you choose to use your personal phone for work. So many meetings, all are required to be on-camera. WFH here is so behind the times, they went from mandated 3 days/month during their “dynamic working” to now a full 5-day work week/month, boasting this dynamic model as some sort of super flexible way for their employees to work. Teams are spread across the country and even internationally, why must employees go into an office to take the same Zoom calls with their out of state team and managers? Dynamic working is a farce dressed up in an appealing package as if employees are considered first, when in reality this is a corporation stuck in micromanaging and sinking money into real estate for show when their talent can absolutely perform well and better WFH. What a blow to morale and how convenient this comes out of nowhere with no discussions with managers and after the pulse survey is complete. Onboarding is super overwhelming and stressful, it seems they have a structure with their training but you’re just thrown in with short deadlines and not much direction. CEO is very clearly struggling with adapting to evolving times and letting go of old ways. I could have dealt with some of these, even the original 3 day/month in-office work.

I felt like I was still in high school going through this program and I don’t really feel much growth. I didn’t go through college just to be stuck in a call center role, getting berated by customers on the daily.

theres a certain level of fear mongering that is used to make sure you do the job like they want you too. probably not best if you already struggle with anxiety. it will definitely kick it up a notch... a couple notches. 
they calculate more stats than you can even think of. these stats will be thrown at you daily and you will be asked to explain every bit if its out of the desired window. bonuses and pay increases depend on that.

Bad job but difficult to rate.,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW67624620.htm,2.0,"Aug 6, 2022",Customer Relationship Advocate,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Greenwood Village, CO",Pros,"They license you. You will think about this experience in future jobs and feel relief that you no longer work here. This job is probably more attainable than the vast majority of others job in ""finance"".",Cons,"Ultimately the job title is ""Customer Relationship Advocate"", so I can't fault Fidelity for being dishonest in anyway during recruiting. However, if you are a college graduate looking for a job, even if you failed other interviews, do not take this job if you want to enter a job that is A) financial and/or B) analytical.

Firstly, Fidelity will advertise the SIE/S7/S63 as a good way to begin your career and potentially jump to something else later. These licenses are required from a compliance standpoint, that is the only reason they require you to take them. These licenses will not land you a job as an analyst or impress anyone who actually knows what they are. If you are only joining to take these exams, I advise against this.

Close your eyes. Do you want to take phone calls all day every for the foreseeable future, with the only promotions available being other roles where you get a slight pay bump and take phone calls all day? This is your life after finishing licensing, and if you're like me you will be put on a 10-hour shift against your preference. 10 hours all day every day of talking to customers is not going to make you very desirable in any actual finance or analytical job.

This job is 97.5% customer service and 2.5% finance. Some might argue it is not finance at all, the most sophisticated thing you will do on a daily basis is place a stock order for a customer who is too lazy to do it themselves. You will get trainings on concepts that most customers understand through internet articles, or you will be trained on proprietary systems, nothing you can even place on a resume to show you as a desirable candidate for when you will want to leave.

This job is basically an office version of a factory assembly line. The second you finish a call you're onto the next, there is no opportunity to extend to any meaningful project that will help you get out of the perpetual call center. The job is designed to keep you working for them in a call center, they already licensed and trained you so this is most profitable for them. 

The only person I can see who would like this job is someone who worked in call centers in the past and sees this as an upgrade since they can call themselves a licensed broker etc.

For anyone who wishes to have career advancement outside of customer service or potentially their wealth management branch (you will start off a brand new role, continuing to do calls all day every day and maybe after 3-5 years get promoted to a branch), extend your job search and look elsewhere.

Lastly, the reason I put ""difficult to rate"" in the title is because I might seem naive for giving a poor rating to a customer service job since it doesn't offer promotions into analytical or financial jobs. But ultimately I can't give this job a good rating whatsoever because everyday was dreadful; never-ending phone calls with no hope for meaningful advancement.",12
Disappointed after reading all the good hype,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW68560958.htm,2.0,"Aug 31, 2022",Principle Software Engineer,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Durham, NC",Pros,"The work is extremely easy . They have good benefits 401k and profit share. They have everything at the company that you can think of as far a technology, so lots to learn for entry level people. Has a decent corporate culture that encourages a good attitude and free speech.",Cons,"Fidelity lacks technical leadership as a whole and does not value it! They value attitude over all else which means they hire people they like and contract out technical folks. They are not lean and Agile, lots of bloat and middle managers. The environment is extremely political and they accomplish very little. It's extremely hard to get anything done with all bureaucracy, meetings. Lots of non-technical folks blowing hot air and not enough GOOD developers. 90% of their developers are not employees but contractors and turn over is very high. As far as fulltime employees go, Fidelity hires low-level tech folks who have a good attitude but lack experience which further exuberates and compounds not getting things done. Lots of silos and teams that only care about themselves, Cross team communication is probably the poorest I have ever experienced in my career. To add to it all, folks regularly switch teams and so you lose people you trained and you have to start over again. As a whole, in my opinion, it's not a great environment to write and test code in. Everything is always breaking and getting things fixed takes days not hours while your whole team is idle. This encourages idleness and apathy.",5

However, I'm not going to be trained in that specific role until at least 4-5 months on the job. I'm willing to stumble blindly through an adventure of learning alongside our customers, but many of them don't have time for that, and me not knowing what I'm doing yet is leading to a poor customer experience for them. The headsets provided for working from home aren't compatible with the onsite phones, so that was an unexpected learning curve. My coach strangely seemed perplexed that I didn't know how to operate the call center equipment already on the first day of calls despite never having seen or used that equipment before. It is extremely difficult for clients to hear me clearly, and often vice versa, due to the background conversations when working onsite.

My major complaint about WPC is that people who play the game and burn through calls get promoted and those who spend time with clients don’t. You are not encouraged to spend time and plan with a client. You are supposed to get your tool clicks, uncover assets and send a referral to a branch. It has developed a culture of work 12 hour days to get your numbers, or cut corners. 


Also, they required mandatory overtime on Monday’s and Friday’s for over 6 months. Demanding total flexibility from all reps and continually asking for more, more, more. But good luck using your PTO. Some managers will act like you are stealing PTO hours from their own bank when you ask. The “COVID relief days” they offered were total BS as well.

- 4-day work week option 
-Tuition Reimbursement/ Student Loan Repayment
- Gym membership Reimbursement
- Constant Overtime Availability 
-Good resume builder
-Sponsored to get FINRA Licenses
-Work from home",Cons,"CRA ROLE: I graduated with a Bachelor’s in finance last year (degree not required for role) and I took this job b/c they advertised being able to become a licensed financial professional with FINRA. My professor indirectly tried to steer me away from it but I was naive. I sat in on a seminar and was really impressed with how happy everyone seemed. I thought getting my foot in the door I would be able to easily navigate and move on to a more technical skilled role. Boy was I wrong… The CRA role is the lowest of the totem pole you can be on. They try to make you feel like you’re not working in a call center because of licensing and the culture but you really are. You take inbound customer service calls. You get trained and have to assist with a magnitude of differing requests such as the status of paper work or educating/placing trades for clients in margin. It felt like I was getting paid so little to know SO MUCH. You are also expected to work chat function several times a week and manage multiple chat conversations at once. 

The busiest times are Tax Season and the end of the year for RMDs. Summer is the slowest— you most often stare at the screen all day with maybe 5-6 calls your whole 8 hour shift. 

PERFORMANCE/ PROMOTION: You are graded on the criteria of the call model & grading is inconsistent. Additionally, the anxiety you feel when you get calls and don’t know what to expect is difficult. A lot of the clients are older and can be rude when they don’t get their way. You have to help them navigate the website which sometimes can take up to an hour. Clients receive follow-up surveys in 24-48 hours after interaction and if you get a 6 or lower it counts as a 0 towards that metric. A lot of clients are unhappy when they don’t know what they are doing and you get the blame for it instead of allowing you to support and expand their knowledge. Weekends are also tough working b/c a lot of supporting business units are closed on the weekends which results in disgruntled customers and call backs (also, a metric your performance gets graded on)
Fidelity allows auto-promotion when you reach certain call review scores and call metrics. They are just other call center roles with a $1,000-$2,000 yearly salary pay increase. After tax is an extra $50-80 dollars per month. Do not be fooled do the math. 
 
TRAINING/ SUPPORT: You will go through a total of 8 months of training. A lot of information to know. Difficult to retain as you will not be practicing skills daily. If you have a question about a procedure or process managers tell you to contact the Help Desk. Crazy b/c you depend on them to measure and assess your performance but they don’t know the job role specifics. 

Overall, this job left me feeling hopeless and unmotivated. I feel like they should be more transparent with what the job function really is. It is not just about becoming licensed and being a financial professional b/c the clients don’t see you as that, they see you as a customer service representative punching bag. Call center work is not for a lot of people, really think about if this is the type of role you see yourself in permanently.",5

Although their salaries tend to be way below what other companies pay. It's a great place to start, get your certifications, and then go somewhere else where they'll double your pay. This is what most engineers were doing at the time I was there. After I left, I doubled my salary at another firm.",Cons,"I worked at Fidelity from 2018-2019 and found it to be one of the most toxic cultures I’ve ever experienced in my 20+ years as a professional. 
I worked in ECC where, although being a highly technical BU, the Sr leadership (at the time), promoted several non-technical people into leadership positions. I worked under one of these, a woman (HJ) who had a knack for hiring and promoting underqualified people, thereby creating a situation where they needed to be “protected” and would be loyal to her. This included promoting an individual from QA to a PM role with zero experience, as well as someone from the event planning dept to a Dir level leading a UX team. 
The situation was so wily, that at one point, this PM (LV) held several meetings to explain to our highly experienced UX team “UX Strategy”. She’d done her research on Google. I wish I was joking. Later, she would hold “UX Strategy” meetings that only included the one UX designer and a young woman whose role was designing PP decks for leadership (SJ). She insisted on defining herself as the UX Researcher, even though (you guessed it) she had no experience doing research and never actually conducted any research. But she was really good at gossiping, slandering, and keeping VP abreast of BU gossip.  I wish I was joking. These people were not only unqualified and unprofessional, they were MEAN.
The PM for this team created a corrosive and toxic environment; she battled constantly with the PO in front of the full 20+ team, deliberately excluded key players from meetings, showed open aggression in smaller meetings, bullied several individuals, and was just a hostile aggressive person in general.
There was another individual promoted by this VP who not only lacked in technical or leadership skills, but was one of the most badly behaved individuals of the entire team (MVH). She led a team of several people and had the emotional IQ of a 13 YO girl. She also bullied members of her own team, behaved in a hostile manner, openly threated team members, and acted appallingly. When new leadership came in and there was a reorg, she kept her position but lost her entire team. That should tell you all you need to know about Fidelity. The fact that all these people are still employed there is insane.
And make no mistake, the behavior of this group of women was endorsed by their own leadership (HJ). They knew they could get away with it and they did. Tactics included: mobbing, bullying individuals and teams, open aggression in meetings, withholding vital information, excluding individuals from specific team meetings, openly threatening individuals, slandering those who refused to play their game, and even firing those who refused to fall in line or pushed back.
Many associates complained to both HR and the Chairman’s line about this group of women, but the only sense we had that they were taking any actions was when HR executives showed up to an offsite event. But you guessed it, nothing happened. HR exists only to protect the firm. If there are no lawsuits possible, they don’t care.
This “leader” is now a VP in PI and continues her abusive, toxic behavior, as well as promoting only those who show their loyalty to her, as evidenced by the woman she just promoted to Director. In fact, all these women still hold positions at Fidelity. They may be scattered across the enterprise, but it’s just a matter of time until VP brings them all back onto her team and it all begins again.",10

-Good job security
- They hire from within before outside, and there are always opportunities to move laterally. Which is encouraged every 3-5 years or so. 
- Many employee resource groups and support programs. 
- lots of networking opportunities. 
- If you want to gain a certain skill or a certain license, management is usually pretty good at finding a way to let you grow skills, even if that means you will leave your current team. Again, they are big on lateral moves.
- A much more relaxed environment compared to other high-stress brokerage firms.",Cons,"- Depending on your position you can be working very long hours. ( Ie Tax season or ""giving season"" will have you working 8 am-8 pm)
- The pay is lower compared to other brokerage firms. 
- Pay is dependent on seniority, not ability. It's incredibly frustrating to be a top performer in a team, but know you make significantly less than a senior team member, who does not perform well. ( you will get raises but you won't be lifted up to the pay level of a person who has been there for 20 years and has grown complacent) The best way to get raises quickly is through lateral movement and negoation. 
- It is very difficult to get a management position, simply because the company is so big, there is always a large pool of applicants to compete against. 
- Many times when people leave, instead of hiring a new person, they pile that job on an existing team member, but will not raise that team member's pay. Just the expectations. 
- The quality of your manager makes a big difference in your experience. Sadly good managers get promoted and move on to better things, and then a novice is sent to replace them. Great for the managers, bad for the senior team members.",

When I tell other actual advisors what Fidelity does they think it’s criminal, they’re selling cheeseburgers and calling it steak. They want to be the largest RIA in the country but this isn’t it.  The investment management arm of the company (Strategic Advisors) is the RIA. This job is trying to use their watered down planning software to convince customers to buy managed products.  FCs are encouraged (read: compensated) to send the relationship to strategic advisors when it’s closed. This is nothing like a real RIA, trust me I’ve worked at two boutiques.

WPC,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW63144354.htm,3.0,"Apr 22, 2022",Workplace Planning Consultant I,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Boston, MA",Pros,"- Decent pay
- Good benefits (very long vesting schedule for some)
- Pay for training/licensing, although Fidelity does have a big problem of reps leaving after being paid to obtain the licenses
- They are currently promoting reps very quickly through the WPA department",Cons,"- Taking phone calls all day long (the majority I had would message you within 5 minutes of not being on the phone, but that could help obviously vary with locations/managers)

- Very high turnover. My team had 5 different managers within 6 months. Reps also leave very quickly to get off the phones. The company really has a plan in place to make their reps stay in the call center as long as possible. Bonus payments are structured to make you feel like it is just close enough to stay for a little while longer. Also a year requirement of work after you obtain your licenses before you can move to a branch role (which are very competitive, and typically are outside hires anyways)

- Extremely sales oriented, but a lot of the clients think we are service. Be prepared for awkward calls where you and the client have completely separate agendas. Instead of servicing the clients need and moving on to help the next, the company would rather you run them through their retirement tools. These tools can be beneficial in some instances, but they are extremely general and many of these clients have recognized that they don’t help much. Seems the department is only here to promote these tools. Only goal on every single call is to take the clients need, acknowledge it while basically ignoring it, run them through the retirement tools so we can gather outside assets, and then set an appointment with a branch so they can move those to Fidelity.

I understand there are plenty of roles similar to this, the only difference is that a lot of the hiring managers at Fidelity do not warn you of this. Multiple reps on my team and I had this same experience.

Overall, this role and the constant phone calls will exhaust you. I would recommend looking elsewhere first if your goal is to get into financial advising. If necessary, this can be a decent role in the short-term.",4

This role requires you to live within 100 miles of Fidelity, yet they do not pay enough for a person to afford to actually live by themselves near Fidelity which is absolutely shameful. It is like being in a minimum wage job except with better pay (though, like I said, still underpaid). You get limited breaks, you are expected to clock in ten minutes early each day, it can be difficult to use your PTO. The customer's rate us on a 7 point scale, but the only acceptable score is 7 points. If you get rated a 6, that is considered failing. This role is very challenging and directly customer facing. There is a lot of pressure because you are dealing with customer's money. Fidelity throws you right into it, I did not feel ready to be moving money for customer's on my own but you just gotta do it. It is great that they sponsor you through the licensing process, but it is really easy to get burned out by their pace. Then, if you fail, prepare to be ""let go."" It is a FINRA rule that licensed employees cannot work from home full time without an exception process that Fidelity is not interested in participating in (it would require them to inspect your home office so I can't blame them for not wanting to do that). We can WFH right now, but will be forced to go in at least part time once it is deemed safe. Fidelity is really pushing for people to return to the office, lots of pressure to participate in ""connect weeks"" which is where you volunteer to go back to the office. They send you a lot of free stuff but most of it is junk. Like cheapy backpacks/mugs/merch you didn't ask for. I am putting this as a con because even though it is nice to receive free things and in the moment it gets you feeling part of the group, this practice has to stop. It is not good for the planet to keep producing useless junk.",14

The pay, the perks, and the people are all great. Fidelity has tried really hard to support employees during COVID, through extra paid leave specifically coronavirus-related, counselor-finding services, fun activities and food provided for people who are willing to come back into the office part time during virus lulls.

Fidelity is also working hard on diversity-and-inclusion, and on making sure employees' voices are heard from the ground up. The company supports outside volunteer efforts and onsite environmental initiatives. You can feel good about working for a company that wants to do good, not just do well.",Cons,"Most people are hired into Fidelity at this position. It's a pretty rigorous process, from submitting the application through multiple interviews. Once you're hired, there are two potential hurdles: first in learning the job then in doing the job.

Oh, the learning process! Even entirely online as it has been since the pandemic, it's kind of fun. There are get-to-know-you activities with your newbie group. But there is also a LOT of information to absorb, and it doesn't let up for months. First you learn the Fidelity systems, then you go through licensing training. You must pass the licensing exams to advance within the company. From hire, this all could take 4-6 months. Yes, they pay you the whole time. Once you're licensed, you alternate more Fidelity-specific classes with actual customer support for a few more months before you settle into full time on the phones. After a few more months of that, you may start applying within the company for new skills and new roles, your options being more self-directed.

So, the cons: the pace of learning is set to warp speed, be prepared! Realize that while you're learning you cost the company quite a bit. It's a lot of stress, but they'll want to push you as fast as they can get you to go. And once you're on the job, well, it depends. Some people like inbound phone customer service, or at least don't mind it. Fidelity customers are usually quite pleasant really. But especially in the busy months, from maybe November through tax season, they can spend more time on hold than they like, which makes them cranky. There will be constant pressure from Fidelity for you to make each call as brief as possible: they will measure both your customer satisfaction stats AND your calls per hour. It can be hard to balance the one against the other. And, this is the job: call after call after call. There are breaks, of course, from weekly team meetings to personal lunch and break time to refresher education. If you can continue in the inbound phones roles long enough, you can eventually get promoted out of it if you choose: perhaps 1-5 years, generally?",2

I will say that they do have a vested interest in taking care of their associates and I do feel more valued than I would in other big-name companies.",Cons,"-Does not sponsor you for licensing unless you are in a role that requires it.

Overall most of the cons can be applied to any big corporate organization.

-Job growth and ability to be promoted within is definitely there, but I have seen some people become stuck in their roles if they stay too long or do not develop skills to move onto the next position. 
- In addition, moving up to management can take quite a while. I have seen it happen within the company, but a large number (especially an overwhelming number of upper-level management) either left the company and came back or were recruited externally. However, this is something that can be seen in almost any company you go to. 

- From the above my experience with management has been great, but I know on some high-intensity teams (such as sales or fund management) can have more stressful managers, but I have not heard anything terrible to note.

"Tech divisions lag the market in tooling, processes, comp, management, leadership, dev experience.",https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW58189775.htm,3.0,"Jan 19, 2022",Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",,Pros,The benefits packages are fully-featured and health insurance is affordable. The best perk of Fidelity is the 7% 401k match and the 10% annual profit sharing; 17% contributions to your 401k overall each year. The work/life balance ends up being very reasonable - it would be uncommon to work a 45-hour workweek more than a few times a year. 40 hours is the very common norm.,Cons,"Fidelity does not use public cloud, which has many negative side-effects; they attempt to replicate that experience with older, internal tooling which dramatically slows developer velocity. For example, engineer's ability to access compute resources is blocked by request processes. Libraries are all subject to a security review which can take a small number of weeks if requested with priority, or many weeks without. Licenses are purchased by a remote requisitions team with a similarly slow resolution timeframe. Releases are produced manually, there is no continuous deployment. 

There is no universal devops/platform team, squads maintain their own services. 
This self-sufficiency produces isolation, practically and socially; process standards and tooling varies a fair amount between them. There is no architecture team or unified technical leadership group. Each squad has their own tech lead and that's it.

Pay for engineers lags the market, targeting approximately 80-100% of the market rate. There is no option to acquire equity. ""Chairman shares"" are offered to top performers, but those are simply 2-year vesting cash bonus - not actual equity. Anecdotally, the very talented engineers remain due to not knowing their own market value. 

The manager-to-report ratio can vary wildly, 50+:1 in some cases, offering virtually no manager facetime or development opportunities to members of those squads. The daily routine of managers and directors is primarily comprised of liaising with customers (other business units) rather than anything related to developing their engineering teams.

Because the tech groups service internal business units, customer requirements are often poorly defined, change frequently and are conveyed verbally to product managers over calls. Oftentimes a change will be reverted due to a customer's whim, not the functionality of the feature itself.

Leadership is adamant about working from the office and will not support remote work post-covid.

Leadership has frequent messaging about undergoing an agile transformation, yet none of the shortcomings described here are eligible for reevaluation. The remaining set of factors that can be changed are virtually meaningless in impact.

Talented top-level leadership want to lead other business units which are revenue centers (all are financial business units) rather than cost centers, so the tech groups end up with a steady rotation of SVPs (the head of the tech group, equivalent to a CEO elsewhere) every 1-2 years. 

In short, the engineer experience at Fidelity is stable, yet slow, uninspiring, and poorly-compensated when compared to the broader market.",1
