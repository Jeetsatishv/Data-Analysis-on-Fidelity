All great. Pretty generous PTO, especially after you have been there a while. The base pay is okay.",Cons,"Fidelity can be great. It depends on two things: what department/role you are in, and your manager. My major complaint about WPC is that people who play the game and burn through calls get promoted and those who spend time with clients don’t. You are not encouraged to spend time and plan with a client. You are supposed to get your tool clicks, uncover assets and send a referral to a branch. It has developed a culture of work 12 hour days to get your numbers, or cut corners. 


Also, they required mandatory overtime on Monday’s and Friday’s for over 6 months. Demanding total flexibility from all reps and continually asking for more, more, more. But good luck using your PTO. Some managers will act like you are stealing PTO hours from their own bank when you ask. The “COVID relief days” they offered were total BS as well. Their policy stated you could use it for anything that required “flexibility” during the pandemic. However, most managers would only let you take it if you were sick COVID.",12

- Work doesn’t come home w/ you 
- Several bonus incentive opportunities
- 4-day work week option 
-Tuition Reimbursement/ Student Loan Repayment
- Gym membership Reimbursement
- Constant Overtime Availability 
-Good resume builder
-Sponsored to get FINRA Licenses
-Work from home",Cons,"CRA ROLE: I graduated with a Bachelor’s in finance last year (degree not required for role) and I took this job b/c they advertised being able to become a licensed financial professional with FINRA. My professor indirectly tried to steer me away from it but I was naive. I sat in on a seminar and was really impressed with how happy everyone seemed. I thought getting my foot in the door I would be able to easily navigate and move on to a more technical skilled role. Boy was I wrong… The CRA role is the lowest of the totem pole you can be on. They try to make you feel like you’re not working in a call center because of licensing and the culture but you really are. You take inbound customer service calls. You get trained and have to assist with a magnitude of differing requests such as the status of paper work or educating/placing trades for clients in margin. It felt like I was getting paid so little to know SO MUCH. You are also expected to work chat function several times a week and manage multiple chat conversations at once. 

The busiest times are Tax Season and the end of the year for RMDs. Summer is the slowest— you most often stare at the screen all day with maybe 5-6 calls your whole 8 hour shift. 

PERFORMANCE/ PROMOTION: You are graded on the criteria of the call model & grading is inconsistent. Additionally, the anxiety you feel when you get calls and don’t know what to expect is difficult. A lot of the clients are older and can be rude when they don’t get their way. You have to help them navigate the website which sometimes can take up to an hour. Clients receive follow-up surveys in 24-48 hours after interaction and if you get a 6 or lower it counts as a 0 towards that metric. A lot of clients are unhappy when they don’t know what they are doing and you get the blame for it instead of allowing you to support and expand their knowledge. Weekends are also tough working b/c a lot of supporting business units are closed on the weekends which results in disgruntled customers and call backs (also, a metric your performance gets graded on)
Fidelity allows auto-promotion when you reach certain call review scores and call metrics. They are just other call center roles with a $1,000-$2,000 yearly salary pay increase. After tax is an extra $50-80 dollars per month. Do not be fooled do the math. 
 
TRAINING/ SUPPORT: You will go through a total of 8 months of training. A lot of information to know. Difficult to retain as you will not be practicing skills daily. If you have a question about a procedure or process managers tell you to contact the Help Desk. Crazy b/c you depend on them to measure and assess your performance but they don’t know the job role specifics. 

Overall, this job left me feeling hopeless and unmotivated. I feel like they should be more transparent with what the job function really is. It is not just about becoming licensed and being a financial professional b/c the clients don’t see you as that, they see you as a customer service representative punching bag. Call center work is not for a lot of people, really think about if this is the type of role you see yourself in permanently.",5
