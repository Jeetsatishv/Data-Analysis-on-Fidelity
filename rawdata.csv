The breadth of this company provides a great opportunity to try out different career paths or boost your current one.,Cons,"In my current role, I am working overtime more often than I'd like with recognition that seems to only go so far until it sizzles out. That may be tied to the size of the company itself, where promotions work in a ""trickle down"" manner.",226,,,,,

Or so I'm told honestly I don't understand why we don't have a single payer system it's insane that to have health care you need a stable job.  Don't even get me started on dental... What are they?  Luxury bones?,Cons,"Despite the fact that the average employee of this company can't even power on a computer my role is the lowest paid in the company.

To be clear the folks who work from home taking chats/calls who escalate their tickets to my team make more than my team. 

Let's talk numbers.

Inflation in 2021 was around 9% but the average raise for my team was 2%.

2022 was again around 9... But we got a whopping 7%.

That's a pay cut baby.  When we spoke to our leadership they literally told us to go find another job.

What's more is there is no out. You are trapped in this role forever or until you find something better elsewhere.  They offer programs to ""help you progress."" but then banish the techs because they don't want tech people. 

They also abuse the ever living crap out of contractors.  They want you as an employee handling people with millions of dollars in trades laptops but they don't wanna give health care.  Incredible.",3,,,,,

Great benefits as well.,Cons,"They claim that there are so many different opportunities to grow within the company, but make it impossible to explore those options due to working a strict schedule on the phones. The call volume is back to back with no room to breathe in between calls. You go through 3 months of training and still feel confused at the end. They encourage you to ask questions and reach out for help, but when you reach out for help, you're reprimanded for doing so. You have no say so in your schedule and you have to work between 12pm-8pm so say goodbye to having any type of social life. They offer free therapy and after working there for about a week, you'll quickly understand why.",3,,,,,

Good 401k match.,Cons,"I was in a 1 year training program for the Financial Consultant role while completing my CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ certification. I was told I needed to sell more insurance, annuities, and managed accounts in order to continue on as a Financial Consultant. I was let go as soon as I hit the 1 year mark, shortly after I became a CFP® professional. I had told HR that I was pregnant when I became concerned about losing my job and asked to be considered for a different role within Fidelity (since I knew I would not be able to interview and start another job at 7 months pregnant). After I was let go by my manager, I reached back out to HR and they were not even aware that my employment was being terminated. Everyone I dealt with at Fidelity was extremely insensitive to the fact that this would cause a huge amount of stress to me and my family at a time that stress had serious potential health risks to myself and my baby. I ended up being unemployed for close to 9 months. I was interviewing for new jobs while also taking care of a newborn and paying extremely high premiums for health insurance for my family. Only 23% of CFP professionals are women, and only about 15% of financial advisors are women. Even though Fidelity touts its family values and culture, I would not recommend Fidelity to women based on my experience.",18,,,,,

The onboarding managers openly compare you to others, bring up personal things in 1 on 1s about other associates and make comments about your life like suggesting you should be married or have children by now. They yell at you on the floor in front of the entire facility if you do something they don't like. The don't advocate for people who have disabilities when it comes to learning the material so you're constantly compared to others openly.

It's for these reasons I've been with the company almost 20 years and plan to retire here if possible.",Cons,"Lately the company has been getting a little political and pushing some activist type initiatives, which doesn't sit well with many employees. They of course won't speak up and say much, especially ones who've been around a while. The company needs to stick to financial matters and stay away from woke agendas or they may face backlash even if their intentions are sound.",2,,,,,

Their 401k match and profit sharing is impressive. Great starting place for a career. Career mobility is available yet there can be ceilings for advancement. Their products and platform solutions are also quite good. Truly a client centric organization and is focused on maintaining that perception. Their approach during Covid was pretty level-headed.,Cons,"Consistent theme where senior mgmt proved to be disinterested and detached from the happenings on the ground. In retrospect, there is also an unhealthy fear within the workforce. There was always a worry about a rumored layoff and then those that always make a point to ‘appear busy.’ Often you will hear from peers or managers that the grass isn’t always greener or that you should think twice before leaving. Other comments regarding excessive workload expectations and having a stressful work environment are also understated. That is pretty consistent across the channels.",3,,,,,

Luxury bones?,Cons,"Despite the fact that the average employee of this company can't even power on a computer my role is the lowest paid in the company.

To be clear the folks who work from home taking chats/calls who escalate their tickets to my team make more than my team. 

Let's talk numbers.

Inflation in 2021 was around 9% but the average raise for my team was 2%.

2022 was again around 9... But we got a whopping 7%.

That's a pay cut baby.  When we spoke to our leadership they literally told us to go find another job.

What's more is there is no out. You are trapped in this role forever or until you find something better elsewhere.  They offer programs to ""help you progress."" but then banish the techs because they don't want tech people. 

They also abuse the ever living crap out of contractors.  They want you as an employee handling people with millions of dollars in trades laptops but they don't wanna give health care.  Incredible.",,1.0,"Nov 27, 2023",Regional Support Technician,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",3

I was let go as soon as I hit the 1 year mark, shortly after I became a CFP® professional. I had told HR that I was pregnant when I became concerned about losing my job and asked to be considered for a different role within Fidelity (since I knew I would not be able to interview and start another job at 7 months pregnant). After I was let go by my manager, I reached back out to HR and they were not even aware that my employment was being terminated. Everyone I dealt with at Fidelity was extremely insensitive to the fact that this would cause a huge amount of stress to me and my family at a time that stress had serious potential health risks to myself and my baby. I ended up being unemployed for close to 9 months. I was interviewing for new jobs while also taking care of a newborn and paying extremely high premiums for health insurance for my family.

In retrospect, there is also an unhealthy fear within the workforce. There was always a worry about a rumored layoff and then those that always make a point to ‘appear busy.’ Often you will hear from peers or managers that the grass isn’t always greener or that you should think twice before leaving.

CRA role: read this first!,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW80500091.htm,,,,,"Merrimack, NH",,,,Pros,"1.) About 20 PTO days, benefits, lots of perks like a concierge you can call to help with anything. 2.) My managers were very good at communicating and looking out for my mental health. I was going through licensing for a call center role and was getting a little burnt out. One of my managers even had a real talk with me about how hard the role was and supported my decision to leave the company. The managers are the real gems.",Cons,"1.) Fidelity requires associates to be in one week every month. Though it was nice to work from home most of the time, the in office week was required and NOT flexible. Sometimes I had to use my PTO days because I was sick and couldn't make it to the office. I would rather be in the office any 5 days of my choosing. 2.) Licensing is hard. Many people left because they couldn't pass the tests (including me). I was in training long enough to see what my role looked like after licensing and it only gets harder. 2.) If you're in the CRA role, please read this first. Do you really want to stay in a job where it's just one call after the other, no idea what it's going to be about, no idea if the client is going to scream at you, and thrown into it without any real training? Fidelity training is very long but does not go over every scenario there is; they expect you to know 100 things while doing something as simple as phone calls. Most of them were password resets or transfers to branches and while most clients were very pleasant, there were some that were outright abusive. I don't blame them as it's managing their money but some could ruin your day. I would not doubt it if my role was completely taken over by AI in a few years. Licensing was fine but once you get to the job it is very overwhelming and exhausting. I knew some coworkers who said that it was very stressful learning so much while also not knowing everything. There just isn't enough time fit everything in your schedule. This was what my day was like when taking calls for two weeks: - 8am: 30 minute team meeting (sometimes this was at 4:30 depending on schedule) - 8:30am: start calls for the day - 10:30am: take 15 min break - 12pm: break for lunch - 1pm: start calls again - 3:30pm: take 30 minute break - 5pm: end day I could take a 45 min break which is measured to the minute while lunch after training is only a half hour. Your whole day will just be phone calls. On my worst day I took about 40 but I've known people who took 60.

They actively try to keep a pc work environment, beyond the virtue signaling you usually see at large corporations, it’s been a nice change of pace feeling like you are truly in a seemingly inert workplace. The expectation for hourly roles is: you clock in on the dot and punch out on the dot without pressure to work extra. They respect your boundaries in this way which is appreciated. The way licensing was structured was nice, you study 90% of the week then come in for a half a day of phones to keep those skills somewhat ready for when you pass. Overall if you’re a recent college grad or looking to make a career transition from another industry this isn’t a bad place to be, you’ll likely get an offer because they have a lot of seats to fill and a decent amount of turnover at the 1-2 year mark.",Cons,"I have worked in other industries and other large corporations before coming to Fidelity, if you’re new to the workforce or new to working for a decent large corp this experience may seem amazing but it’s mostly external and internal marketing driving that narrative. Most of the 5 star reviews for this role specifically must be from somewhat naive folks or folks that can’t see through the “lifestyle” aspects of the culture and can’t see it for what it really is. The recruiter described the training program as “world class” explaining it would be this 8 month process where you’d emerge out the other side a “financial professional”. You certainly learn a lot but most of us who finished the entire program still feel like we don’t know much, it seemed like an long-winded waste of time, Mgmt seems content with the quality of the reps that exit training and Fidelity certainly seems to overpromise and under-deliver on the onboarding side of things but that’s typical for a large corp. Their goal with training is, in their words “pace over perfection” I can’t imagine touting my reps as remotely competent or being a reputable company when the rep answering the phone doesn’t really know what they’re doing. You should change your objective to: “profits over proficiency”. The job is answering 30-40 calls per day, some good some are bad but it’s definitely more customer service orientated, your most prevalent inbound demographics for this role are the elderly, and rude clueless people that can’t do simple transactions on the website. Pay is bad, 23 an hour start, 24 after that, quarterly target is 800.00 and if you exceed the benchmark, which can be challenging with the callers you get (hour long password resets/account management are fairly common and kill your stats) you can be eligible for year end bonus. 51-54k total comp in a metro area is a tight budget to live on.",,3.0,"Jul 18, 2023",Customer Relationship Advocate,Current Employee,5

I would I have recommended this for someone just starting their career but the intense background, drug screening you have to fill 3 cups up. Demand and low pay is not worth it.

They know their stuff. Especially retirement help desk,Cons,"They promote based on calls per hour now. They call them ""automatic promotions"". Basically, people prove that they're good at a job by how short their calls are (even if they're providing inaccurate information during that short time). Managers don't even recognize inaccurate information because they're not specialized on a specific function (ex. Retirement, high net worth, stock plan services, etc.) HR does not care about what an employee has gone through with a specific manager. They always take the manager's side, unless the employee makes a bigger deal about it constantly. The system they use to measure ""calls per hour"" is extremely flawed. It glitches people out of their status codes, which causes their CPH to go down. Management is aware of it, but does not take responsibility. They'll tell the employee to directly connect to their router, and that will minimize the disruptions. This is their solution, rather than changing the way CPH is calculated, or simply making CPH an insignificant measurement. Bonuses for the little guys may or may not come. You also might get scammed out of it by some loophole they find. For instance, they had a tax incentive going on that had an ""attendance kicker"" which meant you couldn't have any ""same day PTO""... however, even for people who scheduled PTO months in advance, because some of it landed on a Friday or Monday, the system counted it as ""same day PTO"" , so those people didn't get the ""attendance kicker"" for that month.",,2.0,"Jun 21, 2023",Retirement Representative,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",4

Diversity & Inclusion is disenfranchising many,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW77657043.htm,,,,,"Salt Lake City, UT",,,,Pros,"Fidelity is a great company for many to start their careers and know the training will be unmatched. The benefits are generous despite the 5 year vesting schedule for the 401k. PTO is 23 days plus paid Federal Holidays for anyone under 5 years more for longer tenure. Many of the perks are geared toward a younger workforce so if you have student loans and want to continue your education, you will be served well by Fidelity's benefits.",Cons,Entry level jobs are not a livable wage given the skyrocketing costs of housing and food in the Salt Lake area. It takes many grade levels of promotion to make much more than entry level pay. Luckily the benefits help make up for some of that but some people just need to be able to pay rent and eat as a priority to being fully vested after 5 years of service. Fidelity is growing at a very rapid pace and with all the diversity and inclusion initiatives it's leaving some groups without certain rights. There are no longer safe spaces for women to be able to deal with bodily functions in safety and privacy. The culture is so inclusive and refreshing but over the top which has also created a level of toxicity where some do not dare advocate for themselves without fear of backlash. Hearing the whispers of dissatisfaction over some of this makes for a fairly stressful environment and might be sewing deep seated seeds of division.

It’s values are based in the idea of helping people, by empowering everyday people to grow their savings and making investing more accessible. Care for employees is also a major focus and it shows in the benefits and pay practices. Many people stay for a long time because they relate to those values and the people are great as a result. Our CEO (Abigail Johnson) is awesome - she pushes her leaders to be on the cutting edge of research and employee practices, and prioritizes modernizing the company. The company isn’t afraid to invest in hiring and projects at times when other firms are contracting, but is responsible and prudent in running the business. Although there is room to continue improving in DE&I, the priority is clear and actually being lived out. Personal growth and risk taking is rewarded in one’s career, and test-and-learn / agile / scrum methods are common in many areas of the business. I’m extremely proud to work here.",Cons,"Because everyone is so values-driven and the company is growing, it is easy to burn yourself out - there are always opportunities to grow and contribute. Leaders are sensitive to this and it’s starting to change (eg some leaders demonstrate more ability to prioritize or set boundaries), but the onus is still on each employee to manage. The upside is that this is a symptom of the company’s growth and hiring - a much better problem than the alternative.

Don’t get me wrong - there are many really smart marketers within the company who know how and want to do the right things….but are blocked at almost every turn. This comes straight from the executive level - the people running the show clearly don’t get how impactful a funded, motivated, technically advanced marketing team can be.

They invest in cloud technologies like AWS and modern web tools like Angular, Node, etc. They even give you 1 day out of every 10 as a ""Learning Day"" to stay up-to-date or broaden your skills. Pay is competitive, and they gave an ""extra bonus"" last year beyond the normal profit-sharing, just because the company had done so well. Work-life balance is encouraged and respected, and PTO is generous. Most of all, I have no concerns about job security in uncertain times!",Cons,"They are a big company. Working for a small startup might be more exciting and adventurous (though some projects within Fidelity have that ""startup spirit"").

There’s about 3 or so weeks of PTO and you can take voluntary unpaid time off too.,Cons,"They require everyone to come on site 5 consecutive days each month when your job can be done better at home. Imagine a room full of phone associates all talking at the same time. Not great for the customer service experience. They love talking about how they support work life balance, but ignore the fact the a lot of employees have to add 2 hours of driving time when going to the office. The 7% 401(k) match doesn’t start until a year after working here and even then you have to wait 3 more years to be vested. A lot of the stats they use to measure call success are not realistic. You can have 90% schedule adherence but if your wrap/idle time is too high (time you use to log calls or use the restroom) then they’ll focus on that. The surveys participants fill out can leave you a positive note, but they’ll label it as “Vague” If a call is transferred and the participant has a bad experience with the second person and fills out a survey, the survey reflects on you because you answered the phone first. Genesis (the system we use for taking calls) has a lot of problems with Mis- transferring calls which causes participants to have a bad experience which makes our jobs harder and our survey scores lower.

We eventually found a compromise where I worked a different shift, but it was very disconcerting that I was told they'd made a mistake and then I had to push to get them to not simply say ""Too bad"". 

We also had a member of our team who practiced textbook ""Call avoidance"" where they would simply sit there and avoid calls forcing more burden on the team. When confronted, the employee admitted to it, but was given another chance. I knew of other employees who were let go for lesser offenses, so there were inconsistent standards at times. 

At the time I left, I had a new manager of approximately a month, and the senior manager spent the entire interview asking me about that manager and how they worked. I let the manager know that she seemed to have some sort of personal vendetta, she fired him shortly after.",1

It's an indication of how absolutely oblivious upper management is to the situation on the ground. 1. Heavy volume of calls- there is NO pause between calls on many days. It's ridiculous to expect people to provide excellent customer service for an eight or ten hour shift when the volume is that heavy. 2. You will be micro-managed. Even if you're intelligent enough to make decisions that are best for the customer, you'll be told to do it according to the protocol, which a good deal of the time doesn't make any sense. 3. You will feel like a robot. You have to follow Fidelity's robotic call structure; miss any element of that and an excellent call becomes 'satisfactory' according to the judgement of ""Quality,"" the Big Brother of Fidelity who evaluate calls. It is EXTREMELY demoralizing to feel like you have done an amazing job and that customers were happy with your service, but Fidelity is going to find a thousand things to criticize you on. 4. You are expected to know (or know how to locate) massive amounts of information. You will be asked obscure questions, and you'll have to sort through electronic encyclopedias of financial information to attempt to find the answer. 5. Customers get screwed over all the time. Somebody taking a $150 payout from their 401K has to pay the same $25 withdrawal fee as someone who's taking out $100K. Want tracking with your rollover check (Fidelity doesn't do direct rollovers)? You're going to pay $25 for that too. There are ""recordkeeping fees"" on most 401Ks. It's a racket.",6

Fidelity MADE is a SCAM!,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW73415449.htm,1.0,"Feb 7, 2023",Customer Relationship Advocate,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Durham, NC",Pros,"Decent PTO- you are going to need it, you will be burnt-out, I have had jobs with half the amount of PTO and not used all of it, I used every single day at Fidelity Paid Training and Licensing- They pay for your licenses and the time it takes to train for them, many people freak out during licensing and say how difficult it is, I found the time to be pretty good, you have most of the day to yourself to study with the materials they provide and then fill in the gaps with Zoom meetings, pretty different experience from when you get on the phones and are glued to your workstation because you never know when the phone will ring. Overall the exams are hard but I passed on the first attempt for each of them and didn't study a minute when I wasn't getting paid to do so. Having said that if you are having a difficult time with the material it may be a different story for you, also you will lose many co-workers during this time since they cant pass the exams. Our team was lucky and only lost a few but others had close to the whole team fail. If you can't pass the exams they often offer you a job with the 401k team but it is for lower pay and much higher call volume. Managers- Your experience may vary but every manager I had was very helpful and easy to approach Coworkers- Once again your experience may vary but I have had several teams in my time with Fidelity and they were mostly all good to work with Campus- This depends on your regional site but Durham has a very nice campus, with on-site cafeteria, albeit mediocre food, walking trail, very nicely equipped gym, Starbucks and ping pong and cornhole. In Durham's case it has some amenities you might expect from a tech site and that is because much of Fidelity's tech is centered in Durham, I have heard from co-workers in other sites that their campus is not nearly as nice and that probably has to do with the fact that non-tech at Fidelity are treated like second class citizens. Also you know what has many of those amenities, my house, so maybe don't force your coworkers to drive in so they can do the same thing they would have done at home but in an office, where it is louder and harder to hear clients Slow Season -During the summer months call volume slows dramatically and you may only take a handful of calls all day. It's not as great as it sounds though because you sit in ready for over an hour sometimes and you never know when you actually will get a call so you are stuck near your desk and if you have to go to the bathroom or get up for a minute you have go into not ready, do that too much and they are going to say you are avoiding calls and it will affect your metrics. Decent amount of off phone time when it is slow. - Not much to add to this one Benefits- This is the number one reason that anyone works for Fidelity, for the ""amazing"" benefits. While the benefits seem amazing at first, if you dig a little deeper they lose a lot of their luster. For example, the incredible match is only offered after your first full year with the company, in the meantime you get nothing and it takes a full five years to vest. The healthcare is pretty good but you are going to probably need it to go on anxiety medication, other benefits sound good but have pretty limited use, such as adoption assistance, commuter assistance that does not cover gas or vehicle payments but things such as public transportation, I don't know a single co-worker who used the bus to get to work nor if there was even one around and lastly, health reimbursement which sounds great but can only be used for classes and not equipment, so it covers Jazzercise but not weights or a treadmill. One benefit that was really great was student loan payments, which only knock on that was it was limited to 2k a year for up to 5 years. Overall the benefits are still really good, however Fidelity is run by smart people and they crunched the numbers and offering these benefits are cheaper than raising base pay.",Cons,"This first part only applies to those interested in getting into tech, so skip ahead if that is not you. Fidelity offers a non-tech to tech training program called Fidelity MADE, which sounds nice on paper and lures many to the company, however it is poorly run and if you do not check the right diversity boxes, you have no chance. It does not matter if you have a bachelors in computer science from a major state university, previous experience with the technologies they use, if you have had previous technical internships, if you have gotten a 100 on your first attempt on the pre-test, none of it matters because the number one thing they care about is satisfying a diversity requirement. Even the recruiter in charge complained that those running the program made them interview everyone that applied regardless of their qualifications and it set them back heavily. Ultimately it took them three and half months to send out rejection letters, a full month behind their schedule. When you get rejected its just a canned rejection letter that tells you to apply next time and continue practicing your technical skills, which is a joke because the interviews barely touch on anything technical and just a bunch of fluff, tell me about a time questions over and over, I suspect they did this so they could justify hiring blatantly under qualified individuals. This was not just me but several candidates with similar qualifications, the only similarity, our demographic. I wasted a full year before I could apply to MADE, practiced with the technologies in my free time and did everything I could do to prepare but it all was for nothing. If you want to break into tech this is not the way to do it. Future of work - They act like they are geniuses for coming up with the concept of hybrid work. There is no reason to have to go into the office when we worked perfectly fine remotely for over a year, but the billionaire boomer CEO thinks it is a great idea. At first it started as just three days every four weeks but then became five days every four weeks. I suspect they are going to go one week on and one week remote in the future but probably want to wait till after tax season so they can stomach the loss of staff better. The worst part about hybrid work is all the people who are only pay grades 1 or 2 can't generally afford to live near campus, so they have to drive, many well over an hour each way without traffic but all the higher ups do not have a problem with it because they get paid enough to afford decent housing near campus. Pay - The pay is mediocre and below industry standard. It is widely talked about how you can go to any competitor in the industry and make more money but the managers have to remind you how great the benefits are. I went up a pay grade and got to cost of living adjustments during my tenure and I barely noticed a difference. Schedule- Like working 8-5, well too bad because after training you will be moved to shift bid. You will be lucky to get anything before your 5th choice. The shifts start as early as 5am and go as late as 11pm so it is more than likely you will end up working odd hours. Tech Support - Fidelity's internal tech team is almost impossible to reach and it can take up to an hour to reach them, the digital tools that you have can be pretty hit or miss and some of them will just stop working randomly, so it would be great to be able to reach them. Also they are incompetent, when you leave the company make sure to get a receipt for your returned equipment because they will be hounding you to return it even though you already did. Client Obsessed - The company likes to say how client obsessed they are but I found this a joke. Very rarely does anyone at the company actually go above and beyond for the client, they mostly just tell you to let the client know you can't do something. Most of the people at the company are too worried about covering their butt rather than actually doing the right thing. Also it does not matter how great you are with the clients and how great your client survey scores are because how do you get promoted? By having enough calls per hour and if you are even a little under that, you are not getting promoted. You are incentivized to get the client off the phone as quickly as possible and if they don't complain it is good enough. Also I love how they say how client obsessed they are but this is the same company that is actively discouraging the use of mail in favor of digital, the clients who stuck with the company for a half century and helped build it into the billion dollar juggernaut today might not want to use a computer and they should not have to go through a lot of hopes to do so. It really won't even be a problem in about a decade since most of the clients that really care about the mail are in their twilight years. Promotions - The promotions are a joke when it comes to pay, you might get like a 5% bump in pay and a chance to make some more in bonuses. Also for auto promotions they only hire in certain departments randomly so if there is a department you want you will have to keep qualifying for them every single month and hope they are hiring that month and also hope you don't get a trade error because then you are disqualified for that month. Most people just take the first department they are offered rather than going through that. Any off phone openings are crazy competitive, they may have two spots open and get over 60 applicants because most people hate their phone role, so if you want off the phone good luck. Tax Season - During tax season, Feb-April you will be non stop busy and as soon as you hang up the phone another one comes in. I have worked in a restaurant for a long time and I was more physically exhausted after this job during the busy season than an active job like that. After spending all day talking to clients you just want to just sit there and do nothing and not talk to anyone, it is the most emotional and mentally draining time. Anxiety- Almost all your co-workers will talk about how much anxiety they feel all the time. This is not during the first few weeks either, we are talking about people who had been there for well over a year. The Sunday Scaries are real and you will probably get them bad. I ended up having to go on prescription medicine to help manage my anxiety and only got off as soon as I left the job. FINRA regulations - This one is not about Fidelity in particular but about the industry as a whole, FINRA regulations are very strict and require you to give a lot of personal information and limit outside business activities and amount of trading you can do in a quarter. Onboarding - The onboarding process takes forever with Fidelity and is pretty messy. The recruiter told me I had to get drug tested within a couple days but the place they wanted me to use was appointment only and did not have any openings during that time frame. Luckily they were able to reschedule but it was very inconvenient to have to panic that I wasn't going to have a job because I could not get the drug test done in time. Recruiters- Some recruiters straight up lie about the job and what it entails, one of them told my coworker that they mostly would be answering emails. The truth is it is a call center and we are not even able to email clients. How the job is advertised - Fidelity makes a big deal of being a financial professional and how you are going to have a series 7 job. The truth is it is a call center and you are going to feel like you work in retail more than working in finance, especially because you are going to be working retail hours most likely after you are done with training. There is a reason most of the people they hire have no financial background and come from retail jobs. The job itself - All this and I never even mentioned what the actual job is like , the truth is it is torture. One co-worker said it best when he said this job should be banned by the Genova convention, not only did I agree, I used those exact words to describe it to other people before. Surprisingly the clients themselves are not too bad and you even get some pretty pleasant and grateful clients but the job is a grind. Not only is everything you do monitored and recorded, it makes it difficult because you never know when the next call is going to come in. The best way to describe the job is like helping your grandma with her online banking details over the phone all day every day. Many of the people are technologically illiterate and almost everything has to be done on their end digitally. The simplest tasks like password resets and adding banking details can easily take over 40 minutes and wreck your stats. Also if you have to reach out to other departments many times they don't want to take the call from you or it can take a very long time to reach them. I have had to wait over an hour for the fraud department to fix simple issues, obviously the client is mad when you get back and the whole time your stats get destroyed. Many departments like fraud and transition services are chronically understaffed and as soon as you get a call that needs them you know you are not going to have a good time. As the client facing member of the team you are going to have to break a lot of bad news and hear some pretty tough situations. If you like waiting on hold and calling your bank's customer service, this is the job for you. Miscellaneous - The same time they required people to go into the office, they canceled the $10 lunch credit, I don't expect to get free food but the food was only worth it if it was free and I thought it was classless to cancel it at the same time as forcing people into the office more. Also no money for bonuses but a few days later we find out they are going to give a quarter billion dollars to underserved students. They virtue signal about diversity but the tech department is the least diverse place that I have ever seen. Wrap Up - Ask yourself why a company that has such ""great"" benefits, that brags about being voted a top place to work, has to spend so much on recruitment ads. The truth is it is a low paying call center and for every success story you see, there are dozens that washed out.",11

I've met some amazing friends and I've loved all of my managers and leads thus far. Management can make or break your experience so its a blessing to have some that you really like. I came in apart of their new LAUNCH program, and the training and support during onboarding was superb!",Cons,"I've always had a gut feeling that things were going to take a turn for the worst after onboarding. It's not terrible, but you're tied to the phones for 8 hours everyday, minus any trainings you're subject to. That is the job we signed up for, but once you're actually doing it full-time, you'll start to hate it. At least I did. You get nice people sometimes, but the participants (people calling in) can be really entitled and annoying. It also seems like everyone is just as confused as you are. They preach about how the F in Fidelity is for flexibility, but it can quickly turn into organized chaos. Most of my training class is still confused about a lot of things when it comes to bonuses, PTO, etc. During training, they'll bring a ton of people in and host panels full of people that preach how awesome Fidelity is. They're not lying per say, but take it with a grain of salt. Go your own path and figure out if it's right for you. The CEO is also trying to make people come in 5 days out of the month (we do 3 currently) starting in January, and they only plan to increase the amount as we go through 2023 and onwards. She's getting a lot of pushback on it because going into the office is draining and a waste of time, since most of us can work more efficiently in our role at home. Salary is a bit on the low end, but they try to make up for it in ""company culture"" and benefits. Most of the benefits I honestly don't use so it would be nice if my salary was higher.",1

Feeling regret after taking this new job. You have to essentially sell your soul to work here, you have to hand over all your financial accounts and there are so many restrictions and requirements with what you can do from your accounts down to outside activity, to social media, and even access to your personal devices if you choose to use your personal phone for work. So many meetings, all are required to be on-camera. WFH here is so behind the times, they went from mandated 3 days/month during their “dynamic working” to now a full 5-day work week/month, boasting this dynamic model as some sort of super flexible way for their employees to work. Teams are spread across the country and even internationally, why must employees go into an office to take the same Zoom calls with their out of state team and managers? Dynamic working is a farce dressed up in an appealing package as if employees are considered first, when in reality this is a corporation stuck in micromanaging and sinking money into real estate for show when their talent can absolutely perform well and better WFH. What a blow to morale and how convenient this comes out of nowhere with no discussions with managers and after the pulse survey is complete. Onboarding is super overwhelming and stressful, it seems they have a structure with their training but you’re just thrown in with short deadlines and not much direction. CEO is very clearly struggling with adapting to evolving times and letting go of old ways. I could have dealt with some of these, even the original 3 day/month in-office work.

theres a certain level of fear mongering that is used to make sure you do the job like they want you too. probably not best if you already struggle with anxiety. it will definitely kick it up a notch... a couple notches. 
they calculate more stats than you can even think of. these stats will be thrown at you daily and you will be asked to explain every bit if its out of the desired window. bonuses and pay increases depend on that.

Bad job but difficult to rate.,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW67624620.htm,2.0,"Aug 6, 2022",Customer Relationship Advocate,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Greenwood Village, CO",Pros,"They license you. You will think about this experience in future jobs and feel relief that you no longer work here. This job is probably more attainable than the vast majority of others job in ""finance"".",Cons,"Ultimately the job title is ""Customer Relationship Advocate"", so I can't fault Fidelity for being dishonest in anyway during recruiting. However, if you are a college graduate looking for a job, even if you failed other interviews, do not take this job if you want to enter a job that is A) financial and/or B) analytical.

Firstly, Fidelity will advertise the SIE/S7/S63 as a good way to begin your career and potentially jump to something else later. These licenses are required from a compliance standpoint, that is the only reason they require you to take them. These licenses will not land you a job as an analyst or impress anyone who actually knows what they are. If you are only joining to take these exams, I advise against this.

Close your eyes. Do you want to take phone calls all day every for the foreseeable future, with the only promotions available being other roles where you get a slight pay bump and take phone calls all day? This is your life after finishing licensing, and if you're like me you will be put on a 10-hour shift against your preference. 10 hours all day every day of talking to customers is not going to make you very desirable in any actual finance or analytical job.

This job is 97.5% customer service and 2.5% finance. Some might argue it is not finance at all, the most sophisticated thing you will do on a daily basis is place a stock order for a customer who is too lazy to do it themselves. You will get trainings on concepts that most customers understand through internet articles, or you will be trained on proprietary systems, nothing you can even place on a resume to show you as a desirable candidate for when you will want to leave.

This job is basically an office version of a factory assembly line. The second you finish a call you're onto the next, there is no opportunity to extend to any meaningful project that will help you get out of the perpetual call center. The job is designed to keep you working for them in a call center, they already licensed and trained you so this is most profitable for them. 

The only person I can see who would like this job is someone who worked in call centers in the past and sees this as an upgrade since they can call themselves a licensed broker etc.

For anyone who wishes to have career advancement outside of customer service or potentially their wealth management branch (you will start off a brand new role, continuing to do calls all day every day and maybe after 3-5 years get promoted to a branch), extend your job search and look elsewhere.

Lastly, the reason I put ""difficult to rate"" in the title is because I might seem naive for giving a poor rating to a customer service job since it doesn't offer promotions into analytical or financial jobs. But ultimately I can't give this job a good rating whatsoever because everyday was dreadful; never-ending phone calls with no hope for meaningful advancement.",12

Has a decent corporate culture that encourages a good attitude and free speech.",Cons,"Fidelity lacks technical leadership as a whole and does not value it! They value attitude over all else which means they hire people they like and contract out technical folks. They are not lean and Agile, lots of bloat and middle managers. The environment is extremely political and they accomplish very little. It's extremely hard to get anything done with all bureaucracy, meetings. Lots of non-technical folks blowing hot air and not enough GOOD developers. 90% of their developers are not employees but contractors and turn over is very high. As far as fulltime employees go, Fidelity hires low-level tech folks who have a good attitude but lack experience which further exuberates and compounds not getting things done. Lots of silos and teams that only care about themselves, Cross team communication is probably the poorest I have ever experienced in my career. To add to it all, folks regularly switch teams and so you lose people you trained and you have to start over again. As a whole, in my opinion, it's not a great environment to write and test code in. Everything is always breaking and getting things fixed takes days not hours while your whole team is idle. This encourages idleness and apathy.",5

The headsets provided for working from home aren't compatible with the onsite phones, so that was an unexpected learning curve. My coach strangely seemed perplexed that I didn't know how to operate the call center equipment already on the first day of calls despite never having seen or used that equipment before. It is extremely difficult for clients to hear me clearly, and often vice versa, due to the background conversations when working onsite.

It has developed a culture of work 12 hour days to get your numbers, or cut corners. 


Also, they required mandatory overtime on Monday’s and Friday’s for over 6 months. Demanding total flexibility from all reps and continually asking for more, more, more. But good luck using your PTO. Some managers will act like you are stealing PTO hours from their own bank when you ask. The “COVID relief days” they offered were total BS as well.

- 4-day work week option 
-Tuition Reimbursement/ Student Loan Repayment
- Gym membership Reimbursement
- Constant Overtime Availability 
-Good resume builder
-Sponsored to get FINRA Licenses
-Work from home",Cons,"CRA ROLE: I graduated with a Bachelor’s in finance last year (degree not required for role) and I took this job b/c they advertised being able to become a licensed financial professional with FINRA. My professor indirectly tried to steer me away from it but I was naive. I sat in on a seminar and was really impressed with how happy everyone seemed. I thought getting my foot in the door I would be able to easily navigate and move on to a more technical skilled role. Boy was I wrong… The CRA role is the lowest of the totem pole you can be on. They try to make you feel like you’re not working in a call center because of licensing and the culture but you really are. You take inbound customer service calls. You get trained and have to assist with a magnitude of differing requests such as the status of paper work or educating/placing trades for clients in margin. It felt like I was getting paid so little to know SO MUCH. You are also expected to work chat function several times a week and manage multiple chat conversations at once. 

The busiest times are Tax Season and the end of the year for RMDs. Summer is the slowest— you most often stare at the screen all day with maybe 5-6 calls your whole 8 hour shift. 

PERFORMANCE/ PROMOTION: You are graded on the criteria of the call model & grading is inconsistent. Additionally, the anxiety you feel when you get calls and don’t know what to expect is difficult. A lot of the clients are older and can be rude when they don’t get their way. You have to help them navigate the website which sometimes can take up to an hour. Clients receive follow-up surveys in 24-48 hours after interaction and if you get a 6 or lower it counts as a 0 towards that metric. A lot of clients are unhappy when they don’t know what they are doing and you get the blame for it instead of allowing you to support and expand their knowledge. Weekends are also tough working b/c a lot of supporting business units are closed on the weekends which results in disgruntled customers and call backs (also, a metric your performance gets graded on)
Fidelity allows auto-promotion when you reach certain call review scores and call metrics. They are just other call center roles with a $1,000-$2,000 yearly salary pay increase. After tax is an extra $50-80 dollars per month. Do not be fooled do the math. 
 
TRAINING/ SUPPORT: You will go through a total of 8 months of training. A lot of information to know. Difficult to retain as you will not be practicing skills daily. If you have a question about a procedure or process managers tell you to contact the Help Desk. Crazy b/c you depend on them to measure and assess your performance but they don’t know the job role specifics. 

Overall, this job left me feeling hopeless and unmotivated. I feel like they should be more transparent with what the job function really is. It is not just about becoming licensed and being a financial professional b/c the clients don’t see you as that, they see you as a customer service representative punching bag. Call center work is not for a lot of people, really think about if this is the type of role you see yourself in permanently.",5

Toxic Culture,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW67490046.htm,1.0,"Aug 3, 2022",Software Enginner,Current Employee,,Pros,"Fidelity is well known for their great benefits. Although their salaries tend to be way below what other companies pay. It's a great place to start, get your certifications, and then go somewhere else where they'll double your pay. This is what most engineers were doing at the time I was there. After I left, I doubled my salary at another firm.",Cons,"I worked at Fidelity from 2018-2019 and found it to be one of the most toxic cultures I’ve ever experienced in my 20+ years as a professional. 
I worked in ECC where, although being a highly technical BU, the Sr leadership (at the time), promoted several non-technical people into leadership positions. I worked under one of these, a woman (HJ) who had a knack for hiring and promoting underqualified people, thereby creating a situation where they needed to be “protected” and would be loyal to her. This included promoting an individual from QA to a PM role with zero experience, as well as someone from the event planning dept to a Dir level leading a UX team. 
The situation was so wily, that at one point, this PM (LV) held several meetings to explain to our highly experienced UX team “UX Strategy”. She’d done her research on Google. I wish I was joking. Later, she would hold “UX Strategy” meetings that only included the one UX designer and a young woman whose role was designing PP decks for leadership (SJ). She insisted on defining herself as the UX Researcher, even though (you guessed it) she had no experience doing research and never actually conducted any research. But she was really good at gossiping, slandering, and keeping VP abreast of BU gossip.  I wish I was joking. These people were not only unqualified and unprofessional, they were MEAN.
The PM for this team created a corrosive and toxic environment; she battled constantly with the PO in front of the full 20+ team, deliberately excluded key players from meetings, showed open aggression in smaller meetings, bullied several individuals, and was just a hostile aggressive person in general.
There was another individual promoted by this VP who not only lacked in technical or leadership skills, but was one of the most badly behaved individuals of the entire team (MVH). She led a team of several people and had the emotional IQ of a 13 YO girl. She also bullied members of her own team, behaved in a hostile manner, openly threated team members, and acted appallingly. When new leadership came in and there was a reorg, she kept her position but lost her entire team. That should tell you all you need to know about Fidelity. The fact that all these people are still employed there is insane.
And make no mistake, the behavior of this group of women was endorsed by their own leadership (HJ). They knew they could get away with it and they did. Tactics included: mobbing, bullying individuals and teams, open aggression in meetings, withholding vital information, excluding individuals from specific team meetings, openly threatening individuals, slandering those who refused to play their game, and even firing those who refused to fall in line or pushed back.
Many associates complained to both HR and the Chairman’s line about this group of women, but the only sense we had that they were taking any actions was when HR executives showed up to an offsite event. But you guessed it, nothing happened. HR exists only to protect the firm. If there are no lawsuits possible, they don’t care.
This “leader” is now a VP in PI and continues her abusive, toxic behavior, as well as promoting only those who show their loyalty to her, as evidenced by the woman she just promoted to Director. In fact, all these women still hold positions at Fidelity. They may be scattered across the enterprise, but it’s just a matter of time until VP brings them all back onto her team and it all begins again.",10

This causes there to be a lot of ""flashy"" things like containers and microservices, but not a lot of talent to utilize them fully which can make things worse than traditional architectures.",4

-Good job security
- They hire from within before outside, and there are always opportunities to move laterally. Which is encouraged every 3-5 years or so. 
- Many employee resource groups and support programs. 
- lots of networking opportunities. 
- If you want to gain a certain skill or a certain license, management is usually pretty good at finding a way to let you grow skills, even if that means you will leave your current team. Again, they are big on lateral moves.
- A much more relaxed environment compared to other high-stress brokerage firms.",Cons,"- Depending on your position you can be working very long hours. ( Ie Tax season or ""giving season"" will have you working 8 am-8 pm)
- The pay is lower compared to other brokerage firms. 
- Pay is dependent on seniority, not ability. It's incredibly frustrating to be a top performer in a team, but know you make significantly less than a senior team member, who does not perform well. ( you will get raises but you won't be lifted up to the pay level of a person who has been there for 20 years and has grown complacent) The best way to get raises quickly is through lateral movement and negoation. 
- It is very difficult to get a management position, simply because the company is so big, there is always a large pool of applicants to compete against. 
- Many times when people leave, instead of hiring a new person, they pile that job on an existing team member, but will not raise that team member's pay. Just the expectations. 
- The quality of your manager makes a big difference in your experience. Sadly good managers get promoted and move on to better things, and then a novice is sent to replace them. Great for the managers, bad for the senior team members.",

They at least offer benefits and a salary. The sales training is good and you’ll be exposed to HNW and UHNW clients to take with you when you leave in 2-3 years.,Cons,"Constant micromanagement around numbers. Calls, appointments, plans, sales pitches, etc.  They say that you are running your own practice but watch every move you make and tell you how to interact with customers.  When I tell other actual advisors what Fidelity does they think it’s criminal, they’re selling cheeseburgers and calling it steak. They want to be the largest RIA in the country but this isn’t it.  The investment management arm of the company (Strategic Advisors) is the RIA. This job is trying to use their watered down planning software to convince customers to buy managed products.  FCs are encouraged (read: compensated) to send the relationship to strategic advisors when it’s closed. This is nothing like a real RIA, trust me I’ve worked at two boutiques. Look no further than the WAS program, where FCs refer clients to actual financial advisors and boutiques. The longest tenured FC in my office was about 3-4 years. Some advice for job seekers, this should be your last option, try to get on with a real RIA first.",1

- Good benefits (very long vesting schedule for some)
- Pay for training/licensing, although Fidelity does have a big problem of reps leaving after being paid to obtain the licenses
- They are currently promoting reps very quickly through the WPA department",Cons,"- Taking phone calls all day long (the majority I had would message you within 5 minutes of not being on the phone, but that could help obviously vary with locations/managers)

- Very high turnover. My team had 5 different managers within 6 months. Reps also leave very quickly to get off the phones. The company really has a plan in place to make their reps stay in the call center as long as possible. Bonus payments are structured to make you feel like it is just close enough to stay for a little while longer. Also a year requirement of work after you obtain your licenses before you can move to a branch role (which are very competitive, and typically are outside hires anyways)

- Extremely sales oriented, but a lot of the clients think we are service. Be prepared for awkward calls where you and the client have completely separate agendas. Instead of servicing the clients need and moving on to help the next, the company would rather you run them through their retirement tools. These tools can be beneficial in some instances, but they are extremely general and many of these clients have recognized that they don’t help much. Seems the department is only here to promote these tools. Only goal on every single call is to take the clients need, acknowledge it while basically ignoring it, run them through the retirement tools so we can gather outside assets, and then set an appointment with a branch so they can move those to Fidelity.

I understand there are plenty of roles similar to this, the only difference is that a lot of the hiring managers at Fidelity do not warn you of this. Multiple reps on my team and I had this same experience.

Overall, this role and the constant phone calls will exhaust you. I would recommend looking elsewhere first if your goal is to get into financial advising. If necessary, this can be a decent role in the short-term.",4

-True competence and hard work was noticed by managers, but rarely actually rewarded. Only numbers were considered important, and these metrics were easy to manipulate if the employees lacked integrity. If you wanted to succeed, you had to be prepared to cheat in one way or another.

-Complete lack of mobility between departments. Many employees joined the company because they were told that it was possible to transition to analyst work. When they became eligible to move departments, they were mysteriously kept in customer service (even if they worked very hard and networked well in order to be able to leave).

This role requires you to live within 100 miles of Fidelity, yet they do not pay enough for a person to afford to actually live by themselves near Fidelity which is absolutely shameful. It is like being in a minimum wage job except with better pay (though, like I said, still underpaid). You get limited breaks, you are expected to clock in ten minutes early each day, it can be difficult to use your PTO. The customer's rate us on a 7 point scale, but the only acceptable score is 7 points. If you get rated a 6, that is considered failing. This role is very challenging and directly customer facing. There is a lot of pressure because you are dealing with customer's money. Fidelity throws you right into it, I did not feel ready to be moving money for customer's on my own but you just gotta do it. It is great that they sponsor you through the licensing process, but it is really easy to get burned out by their pace. Then, if you fail, prepare to be ""let go."" It is a FINRA rule that licensed employees cannot work from home full time without an exception process that Fidelity is not interested in participating in (it would require them to inspect your home office so I can't blame them for not wanting to do that). We can WFH right now, but will be forced to go in at least part time once it is deemed safe. Fidelity is really pushing for people to return to the office, lots of pressure to participate in ""connect weeks"" which is where you volunteer to go back to the office. They send you a lot of free stuff but most of it is junk. Like cheapy backpacks/mugs/merch you didn't ask for. I am putting this as a con because even though it is nice to receive free things and in the moment it gets you feeling part of the group, this practice has to stop.

The pay, the perks, and the people are all great. Fidelity has tried really hard to support employees during COVID, through extra paid leave specifically coronavirus-related, counselor-finding services, fun activities and food provided for people who are willing to come back into the office part time during virus lulls.

Fidelity is also working hard on diversity-and-inclusion, and on making sure employees' voices are heard from the ground up. The company supports outside volunteer efforts and onsite environmental initiatives. You can feel good about working for a company that wants to do good, not just do well.",Cons,"Most people are hired into Fidelity at this position. It's a pretty rigorous process, from submitting the application through multiple interviews. Once you're hired, there are two potential hurdles: first in learning the job then in doing the job.

Oh, the learning process! Even entirely online as it has been since the pandemic, it's kind of fun. There are get-to-know-you activities with your newbie group. But there is also a LOT of information to absorb, and it doesn't let up for months. First you learn the Fidelity systems, then you go through licensing training. You must pass the licensing exams to advance within the company. From hire, this all could take 4-6 months. Yes, they pay you the whole time. Once you're licensed, you alternate more Fidelity-specific classes with actual customer support for a few more months before you settle into full time on the phones. After a few more months of that, you may start applying within the company for new skills and new roles, your options being more self-directed.

So, the cons: the pace of learning is set to warp speed, be prepared! Realize that while you're learning you cost the company quite a bit. It's a lot of stress, but they'll want to push you as fast as they can get you to go. And once you're on the job, well, it depends. Some people like inbound phone customer service, or at least don't mind it. Fidelity customers are usually quite pleasant really. But especially in the busy months, from maybe November through tax season, they can spend more time on hold than they like, which makes them cranky. There will be constant pressure from Fidelity for you to make each call as brief as possible: they will measure both your customer satisfaction stats AND your calls per hour. It can be hard to balance the one against the other. And, this is the job: call after call after call. There are breaks, of course, from weekly team meetings to personal lunch and break time to refresher education. If you can continue in the inbound phones roles long enough, you can eventually get promoted out of it if you choose: perhaps 1-5 years, generally?",2

Overall most of the cons can be applied to any big corporate organization.

-Job growth and ability to be promoted within is definitely there, but I have seen some people become stuck in their roles if they stay too long or do not develop skills to move onto the next position. 
- In addition, moving up to management can take quite a while. I have seen it happen within the company, but a large number (especially an overwhelming number of upper-level management) either left the company and came back or were recruited externally. However, this is something that can be seen in almost any company you go to. 

- From the above my experience with management has been great, but I know on some high-intensity teams (such as sales or fund management) can have more stressful managers, but I have not heard anything terrible to note.

"Tech divisions lag the market in tooling, processes, comp, management, leadership, dev experience.",https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW58189775.htm,3.0,"Jan 19, 2022",Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",,Pros,The benefits packages are fully-featured and health insurance is affordable. The best perk of Fidelity is the 7% 401k match and the 10% annual profit sharing; 17% contributions to your 401k overall each year. The work/life balance ends up being very reasonable - it would be uncommon to work a 45-hour workweek more than a few times a year. 40 hours is the very common norm.,Cons,"Fidelity does not use public cloud, which has many negative side-effects; they attempt to replicate that experience with older, internal tooling which dramatically slows developer velocity. For example, engineer's ability to access compute resources is blocked by request processes. Libraries are all subject to a security review which can take a small number of weeks if requested with priority, or many weeks without. Licenses are purchased by a remote requisitions team with a similarly slow resolution timeframe. Releases are produced manually, there is no continuous deployment. 

There is no universal devops/platform team, squads maintain their own services. 
This self-sufficiency produces isolation, practically and socially; process standards and tooling varies a fair amount between them. There is no architecture team or unified technical leadership group. Each squad has their own tech lead and that's it.

Pay for engineers lags the market, targeting approximately 80-100% of the market rate. There is no option to acquire equity. ""Chairman shares"" are offered to top performers, but those are simply 2-year vesting cash bonus - not actual equity. Anecdotally, the very talented engineers remain due to not knowing their own market value. 

The manager-to-report ratio can vary wildly, 50+:1 in some cases, offering virtually no manager facetime or development opportunities to members of those squads. The daily routine of managers and directors is primarily comprised of liaising with customers (other business units) rather than anything related to developing their engineering teams.

Because the tech groups service internal business units, customer requirements are often poorly defined, change frequently and are conveyed verbally to product managers over calls. Oftentimes a change will be reverted due to a customer's whim, not the functionality of the feature itself.

Leadership is adamant about working from the office and will not support remote work post-covid.

Leadership has frequent messaging about undergoing an agile transformation, yet none of the shortcomings described here are eligible for reevaluation. The remaining set of factors that can be changed are virtually meaningless in impact.

Talented top-level leadership want to lead other business units which are revenue centers (all are financial business units) rather than cost centers, so the tech groups end up with a steady rotation of SVPs (the head of the tech group, equivalent to a CEO elsewhere) every 1-2 years. 

In short, the engineer experience at Fidelity is stable, yet slow, uninspiring, and poorly-compensated when compared to the broader market.",1

I've interviewed several times with a 20 to 1 ratio for applicants vs. positions offered. Everyone that stayed made a lateral move within the company. They changed positions but didn't get a bump in pay. A lot of promises and motivational meetings are given on career mobility, but most can't move anywhere easily. Climbing the ladder takes years. For most, it takes a lot of education, experience, and exceptional stats. I saw a guy with a CFP, 3 years of financial advisement experience, a degree in finance, and excellent testing/current role scores lose a job to a woman with 1-year furniture sales experience. He couldn't move out for a long time. I've seen that happen to several people where the promotions were not fair based on diversity hiring. Qualified people get passed up frequently for diverse applicants. I worked with several people that had multiple years of financial experience and a few that had MBA's that didn't move any easier than people in their 2nd year of college. Experience/education/certifications don't help very much. Lots of people apply for every job.

Tuition reimbursement 90% if you pass your classes with a C. Masters degrees converged at 10k per year if you major in a relevant field.

Flexible time off without fear of reprisals.
Stay employed even in lean economic markets. 
Fathers get 3 months of parental leave for new borns.
Adoption services.
Concierge services for those who want to plan that special date or marriage proposal.

Paid child care by the firm on days they need you if come in if another sight is snowed by request. Discounts on other days at approved sites.

Night time Differential pay at 5% for folks who work past 6 PM. That increases to 20% for those who work past 8 PM of your eligible based compensation per hour. 

Christmas bonuses 2 to 3 times every five years. Usually 1 pay period awarded. There have been other types of incentive pay depending on call volume to encourage us to not cancel auto OT when applied awarded in cash, stock grants, one day off, Fidelity cash for merchandise, etc.

No weekend requirements for those supporting workplace roles. Personal investments roles may have weekend hours depending on the job.

More Telework is available due to Covid19.

Real career development exit here. Some managers are better at this than others. I’ve always felt that they’re pushing me to take up the next challenge. Even at times when I wasn’t ready to move up or just getting complacent.

Fun stuff at call centers. Choose any of these clubs: Women in Leadership, Aspire, FidVets, FinTech, President Circle, Leadership Summit, etc... they always have something going on for you to network and use to move on up. It’s up to you to hustle and play the game.

Pre Covid19 we had hot air balloon rides, dragon boat competitions, BBall breaks, volleyball teams, zombie nights for Halloween, BBQ competitions, ice cream socials, team outings, camping trips, visiting chefs at some sights, team potlucks, free food and I’m talking about the good stuff NOT pizza. You can definitely gain major weight at certain sites.

No worries because some sites have a full service gym w/ personal trainers, classes, and nutritionists.

 At Our sites we got the choice to take a walk and discuss our development plans or monthly business results around one of the many nature trails.",Cons,"Bonus metrics change a lot.

Managers depending on the site location change a lot in the call centers for sure.
 
Will push you hard to keep up with the ever changing metrics in order to stay relevant if you want to get promoted. Only to hire a guy off the street to the branch with 6 months of car sales experience, no degrees in the field, and has to still get his S7 & 63.

You have a better chance of jumping a few slots to get to where you want if you work at Fidelity for 1-3 years. Quit; then work elsewhere for 1-2 years only to come back to Fidelity.

Serious issues at to many of the branches when it comes to hiring women, professionals with ascents, or they may serve in locations with above average demographics or immigrants without one person in the branch that can speak their language. These folks tend to have small to midsize size businesses. They horde cash and don’t have someone they trust to reach out to them. However, executive management is aware and working on making the hiring process better. I can tell that change is happening. It’s not HQ more so the mindset of the financial industry at the local levels. 

Management feedback for the interview process can be largely lackluster. Heard from other top performers that the feed back was non existent or borderline suspect. Being told to smile more during the interview or joke more at team meetings is NOT productive feedback for a job interview. Especially when they seem to selectively provide this to certain “types.”

Healthcare plan is average. Family plan is 3k high deductible. They do give you $1500 per year to your HSA to offset that high @-&:?:?’ Plan. Prescription med and co pays prices were higher for me than my previous employer.

Pay is actually lower than the national average for a license professional.",3

Abby Johnson attempting to create the cult called Fidelity is failing and outflow at the firm is coming. They’re anti-fiduciary approach will cost them majorly with the CFP Board.

 They take no feedback from employees with knowledge of this and other things that are unethical and would violate even Reg BI.

Recruiters will tell you that unless you have a CFA Level I upon graduation from an Ivy League school , or you can never be an analyst. After LinkedIn review this is not true, and I cross referenced who didn’t qualify for those “standards” I found those not from Ivy League had some nepotism within the company, generally at a VP or higher level 

This east coast bias here is incredible. Call centers everywhere else-with about 1/5 the pay of anyone in Massachusetts. 

I don’t recommend this firm to anyone. They’ll preach a holistic happy fun approach- the reality is nothing close. 

Abby Johnson just because you were born into the most successful mutual fund company- does not mean anyone should worship you the way it’s demanded from the top down. It’s actually pretty pathetic you feel the need to plaster your own quotes and face everywhere. 

Best of luck to all those who dare enter these jobs. Congratulations to those who’s dad bought them an Ivy League education and nepotistically raised the wealth differential in this country. Fidelity is the epitome.",3

So many perks and benefits I literally cant fit it all on here.",Cons,"Ever ask yourself ""How can I simultaneously destroy my career prospects and waste my expensive college degree?"" Well then , Fidelity Investments in Jacksonville has the perfect job for you! 

First, it's a call center people...through and through. You will talk to dozens of people on the phone. Every...single...day. Eventually, that ""ding!"" sound of a new call coming in will haunt your dreams. Most people don't last more than a year. You can either go the sales or service route. If you go service, there is very little room for advancement. In addition, if you move into whats called a ""High Net Worth"" service role, you will be responsible for a HUGE range of knowledge and actions without commensurate pay. One call could have you rushing to get a complex option trade placed within minutes of market close, while a pushy day trader berates you, and the next call could be spending an hour helping a 90 year old man reset his password as you bang your head on you desk asking ""I went to college for this?!"" If you go sales, then get used to working long, awkward hours and having your success defined in how many more calls you can take than the next guy/gal. 

The coupe de grace (ATTENTION ALL RECENT COLLEGE GRADS): None of the jobs they offer in Jacksonville are real finance jobs. They're just customer service/sales jobs parading as something fancier. Even the ""Financial Advisor"" roles are just sales, albeit well paying. Also, call center jobs are only marketable to other customer service careers. Having a call center job on your resume will actually HARM your chances of landing a job in world of ACTUAL finance. So, before you go thinking ""I'll just work here for a year or two to get something on my resume""....DON'T DO IT.

None of what I just said should reflect poorly on the company itself, because Fidelity is a great company in terms of culture, mission, and values. That's undeniable. The problem is very specific to the extent of their operations in Jacksonville being call center based and that these are very stressful and career-limiting work environments. Consider yourself warned!",10

But, because its Fidelity, the clients wait for 50-200 minutes or more to speak with you, they are, as you would expect, not happy by the time you speak with them. (These are the clients filling out your survey, and only PERFECT surveys count). The queue of clients to speak to is endless. Over time the bad attitudes and angry people yelling at me wore me down and I lost 15 lbs, because skinny anxious and depressed, and essentially sacrificed my personal self to chase my professional goal to move to a different job where the clients don't wait as long. However, the rhetoric and promise of changing jobs, the date keeps getting pushed back. Now they are refusing to do internal promotions, due to the egregious client hold times. This is a LOSING TEAM. Go join a winning team. 

If you don't live there already, you have to move to the city to WFH

No real team atmosphere

Clients yelling at you and disrespecting you.

In the words of management ""this is the bottom of the company""

In the words of my former manager ""this is the hardest year at the company, and this is the worst version of the hardest year at the company ever""

Except, this year is different, because the company is literally NOT PROMOTING the loyal employees who worked through the hell of December-March.

If you call Fidelity this upcoming December 2021, you will experience an unacceptable hold time of at least 70 minutes, and you will work with someone brand new and incompetent.

Since I joined, my class of 30 people, about 14 have quit or been fired for yelling back at clients, or failing their Finra exams.

Again, I cannot emphasize enough, this is a LOSING TEAM and the teflon-covered management give you lip-service about the future getting better, yet the carrot gets pushed farther and farther away.

Even in this terrible environment, when my peers got only 40% ""perfect surveys"" my record month was 91%.

I have been asking for help since January to get into a different role that fits my background and skillset.
Now, I have other companies offering me jobs that pay more than 2x the $48,000 at Fidelity.

Unless you plan to become an advisor (cough...salesman), most of the jobs you will find in the world of personal investments/brokerage services are going to be a CALL CENTER JOB! This is just the nature of the beast, yet something that your career counselor at college probably wont tell you. Call center experience is only a marketable skill to more customer service jobs.  I have worked at Fidelity for several years and can honestly say that I feel I have wasted years of my life doing something I have grown to absolutely despise. Dealing with customers on the phone is a life-draining experience. So let's bring it back to Fidelity, shall we? Would you like a real-life sample of what your job will consist of as a ""Financial Representative"" or ""Customer Advocate"" at Fidelity? Well, say no more!:

8:00 a.m. - Distribution check request.
8:10 a.m. - Hour long password reset with 90 year old client. (College degree hard at work!)
9:10 a.m. - Distribution check request.
10:10 a.m. - Help client find tax form online. 
10:15 a.m. - Why wont my debit card work?
10:25 a.m. - Why wont my credit card work?
10:35 a.m. - Complex multi-leg option trade.
10:45 a.m. - 30 minute password reset with 80 year old client. ( I went to college for this?)

Now rinse and repeat this for 30 calls a day, day in and day out. Not exactly what you pictured yourself doing with that shiny, expensive college education, is it?
Look...I could go on and on about other details of the job (particularly the wacked-out survey questionnaire Fidelity bases a large portion of your bonus on) but I'll leave that for some other disenchanted soul. Here is the bottom line...if you want to do sales, that is great for you and you will find many career opportunities at any brokerage firm, including Fidelity, and you will make a great living doing so. However, if sales is not your thing then I highly suggest you look elsewhere.",77

Pay quickly stops after several years to a grinding halt, even with stellar reviews. Most of these positive reviews are from newbies who are the only ones fidelity invests in. After a couple years, trust me, you'll be begging to get out of their militant and lack of resource style. Managers know nothing about your role, as Fidelity typically hires managers with no knowledge of the role as they believe managers are their to ""manage"" and not need be experts at the technical aspects of the role. With that said, where do you go for guidance? Glad the police, fire department or pilots aren't hired Fidelity style. Who is the go to contact if your manager doesn't have a clue about the day to day of your job? Being a manager is a great deal at Fido as they have zero accountability and throw you under the bus if need be. I've been there 7 years and have a rockstar performance record, so this review is not in spite, rather it's just reality. Get in, get your license and experience on their dime, get out. Was a great employer years gone by, but as Ned once said ""Our employees are our biggest asset"" has not been heard in years and years.

Some groups work in crowded arrangements because leadership will not support any official work from home arrangements.
Lack of oversight on Directors and Vice Presidents with direct reports. A bad apple can really tear a department apart. 
Review process is not individual. People are stack ranked and there are quotas on high ratings. Even if you have 2 star performers, only 1 can receive the most excellent rating. The process is truly not individualized.
People provide reviews for employees they have had very little interaction with. Can get very personal.

You are told when you are hired and during training that customer service and advocating for the customer is the main goal.  That you should ""own the call"". However as soon as you are on the phones, you are told that once the customer is handed off to what ever dept ,  you should not be involved anymore, that you should not make too many outbound calls to the customers because we are an inbound call center , I do not consider this owning anything.  The procedures and resources are time consuming and cumbersome.  Your computer is prone to freezing when you are in the middle of a call because of all of the resources you have to have up,  and yet you can not say anything about your computer not working properly. 
  Fidelity has compassion as part of it's mission statement , yet most of the procedures could not possibly show less compassion for the customer if they tried.  In short I feel like I was lied to about the position I was hired for.   
   Management shows favoritism as well as cliquishness, and though everyone appears to be friendly it is surface only.  You never know what management expects or what they are in charge of  because it changes constantly.",6

I truly love Fidelity and what they stand for. I just hate the role I'm in.",Cons,"The role just sucks, especially if you work nights because they never hire enough people to work late nights so people can wait up to 10 minutes just for a password reset! It's a call center so it's constantly taking call after call and people can be too needy or hostile because they can't treat their retirement account like an ATM. You have to be in the role for at least a year to even be considered for other roles though it will just be another job on the phone all day. Also your calls are graded all the time and depending on your manager... it's a miracle if you do anything right on a call. Some people call in to get a balance and just because you didn't get the persons life story doesn't mean the call was ""inconsistent"". Metrics are so whack.",9

I still feel like upper management is slightly disconnected to what we have to do vs. industry standards vs. their expectations. Lastly, we have an internal feedback board we can utilize to provide customer as well as coworker feedback, however the time frames from when the research of a project starts to when it completes can be well over 1 year.

Benefits used to be among the best in the industry but that has fallen in recent years.,Cons,"In my department advancement, whether in the form of formal promotions or stretch assignments, go only to those with contacts at higher levels.  Midlevel managers routinely tell subordinates that they believe the subordinates deserve advancement but that none is available unless the subordinate can figure out a way for senior managers to take notice.  Senior managers don't believe this is a problem because they see promotions going to the people they know are good.  They are oblivious to how many good people work there that they don't know.  That is because people rise to the top at Fidelity by managing up, not managing down.

There are two types of senior managers.  One is the Fidelity Lifer who understands how to play the game.  Don't try to change anything, don't take any chances, figure out how to not get your finger prints on anything that might fail and know that after 20 years you can retire extremely wealthy.  The other is the short timer who comes in from another company expecting to get things done.  They take chances, they get involved in new projects that take the company in new directions and they are the first to be blamed when things fail.  These people rarely last long.",5

Plus if you choose the high deductible health plan they give you 1k towards your HSA.
Other: good nice people/ coworkers. Some work/life flexibility depending upon the job.",Cons,"No matter how many times employees tell them that Fidelity pays lower salary than other companies they always say it’s comparative to the current market, and of course they tout all the benefits. For some tenured employees the benefits package keeps them there but younger employees don’t see it that way and just want the base pay.  I was an employee for over 12 years and always felt I was underpaid at the base salary.  They don’t seem interested in retaining hard working, SP rating employees who execute on the work. You have to be a superstar to be recognized.
Other: so many layers of approval to get to any type of decision, lots of group consensus needed.
Career oops: they are all into talking about mobility right now but it seems to be towards more younger employees to keep them engaged.
When jobs are eliminated: it’s almost always people age 40 and above. You can have a department of 80 people and the people getting laid off are always above 40.",5

Meeting-heavy culture...lots and lots of meetings.
Have to wait 1 year to participate in 401K.
Tenured employees (15-20+ year) are mostly unwilling to change or transform the way they work, or be influenced by new thinking.
Career growth is limited for back-office employees and most job requisitions require you to live in the geographical area (TX, NC, or MA) in order to be considered for the job.
Lacking leadership skills at Director level, VP, and above creating a micro-managing culture and toxic work environment. 
HR is passive in giving employee support and really only advocates and acts upon anything for the benefit of the manager and company.
Way too many Executives and layers of management.
Spending or investing via your Fidelity checking and 401K accounts are monitored by your manager.

Often in areas where there aren’t many other good jobs. Upper management wants to do the right thing, but often dies in the middle.",Cons,"My biggest issue is with middle management. If associates don’t want to go into sales, the only other option is management, which is often not a good fit. You’d have managers who just weren’t “people” people, who would be leading a team of 20+. Managers also have the ability to make or break your career. They control your pay, bonuses, reviews and even promotions. I don’t believe one (possibly inept) person should have control over basically your life. Favoritism runs rampant, which is awesome if you’re a favorite, sucks if you’re not. I had many managers, some who loved me and would mentor and promote me and sing my praises from the rooftop, and then others who gave me very low performance reviews (how is this possible?) 

They’re just SO HUGE with so many different business groups that people wouldn’t know what jobs are out there. Sales or management was all people knew, wish there was more transparency so people who aren’t fit for mgmt wouldn’t go into those roles. Upper management initiates also die at the middle management level due to their inertia and stubbornness.",5

As a senior person in my position you get to know the skill set that is important for your job. When you do outstanding work you soon realize that advancement Is not based on merit but who you are aligned with. A company that is interested more in protecting management with an emphasis on the org chart and less about the work itself. Constant internal battles and intentional reorganizations. An internal employee goal program that ignores how you want to grow as an individual instead focusing on how a manager wants you positioned. If you get a good manager that focuses on the work it can be a wonderful place but soon there will be a reorg and and you will find yourself having to pay more attention to the political back channels and less on your passions and skill set. Politics is extended externally as well with profits spent on preventing governmental ""regulation"" but internally a love of regulating the employee. Highly protectionist from the top on down.

Very good pay and benefits. 

Culture depends on the division you're in -- I used to work in Strategic Advisers, Inc. (later rolled up into Asset Allocation) and the majority of the people that I worked with in that group were incredibly nice and smart. I'd heard not-so-great things about some of the other divisions at Fidelity, though, so I counted myself fortunate. Compared to the other floors in my building (245 Summer St), my floor was relatively casual and the floor plan was more open -- large half-cubes instead of the cube farms at the Smithfield, RI campus. Because I worked on a floor with portfolio managers and other members of investment management, we also got nicer drinks in the fridge.

I also had a very kind and nurturing manager and a good team.",Cons,"Even within the division that I worked in, there were a few deadweights -- people who had made it to middle management after being at the company for 15+ years and were really just complacent and there for the paycheck. Those people were always a drag to work with; fortunately, I was able to minimize my dealings with them and usually partnered with the research and investment teams, who were filled with smart, driven people.

One other con was that it IS a big corporation, so change does come fairly slowly, and there are constant re-orgs and re-branding initiatives, which can get a bit difficult to keep track of. It can also be hard to get things done in an efficient manner because there are always a million stakeholders on each project.",

Compensation: The base pay (at least for my role) is way too low for what I do. 

Job: My job itself is manageable but stressful at times already. When people leave, they put that person's job on other people, with no raise or any acknowledgment of how the person's doing. The job you add on, you may not even be qualified for under in the industry. Also, they add on useless tasks to do (that other locations don't do) just for no reason at all. We have all of these tasks to do with no extra pay or help from higher management. The higher up people do not even know how to do the jobs we have which I can say from my experience here for sure.

Customers: some of the clients are absolutely absurd. they come in asking for things and you try to help them and give them caring honest answers and they dont care. it just adds on to the stress.

Company: During the pandemic they've put completely unrealistic protocols that do not make the clients happy (not being able to walk in places). Although I understand it's important to be safe during the pandemic, other companies allow it, so why not here? This just makes the clients very angry, more than already about their needs, and they go off on us service reps as if it is our fault. We take the heat. When we present it to a manager they do not care and tell us to try to resolve it more. If it escalates too much to a manager then they just blame the company and seem not to care. 

P.S. If you have a fidelity account and need help, do NOT call the service number because there is a 1% chance someone will answer in the first 10 minutes.",6

This is a financial sales company, not a financial services firm.  The goal year in and year out is to maximize sales at the cost of providing true financial planning services to clients and developing relationships.
Book sizes are over 500 and by nature, representatives have little incentive to interact with current book clients unless there is new money coming in.  Reps are constantly not following up with their own clients because there is no incentive to stay true to a relationship model.  The planning is a masked service, run by computers and over complicated pieces of marketing material.  When each ""solution"" for a client is a fidelity managed account, you start to question what actual planning you are really doing.  If I client does not want a managed account, there is barely anything you can do for them, besides show them how to research on their own, defeating the purpose of a ""guidance"" appointment.  Management is constantly looking at ways to better the years previously at the cost of the reps and the clients.  More appointments, more phone calls is the name of the game.  It is impossible to keep a relationship model when this is the driving force behind it.  

If you want to provide financial planning guidance in a more meaningful way, it is best to join an RIA, which is where fidelity is losing most of its staff to anyway.",8

You might have managers or trainers that have never been in your seat, or could not cut it so they transitioned. Makes it difficult to have them coach when they have not done it.

Fidelity at the top of your resume or anywhere on your resume gets you noticed in the marketplace. It's a private company instead of public company so it's not pressured by the Wall Street quarterly earmings mentality, and that's a HUGE difference-maker in a great way. It's a well-capitalized company and they spend a lot on technology; I've honestly never seen anything like it. Some very smart people there, too, and some of them were even nice. Fidelity has a variety of businesses within the organization and people do move around.",Cons,"A lot of uncertainty from the top down, and most rank-and-file employees feel very out of the loop and not very empowered. Restructurings and management changes seem to be arbitrary and tend not to improve things; it almost feels like someone's tinkering with things because they believe they need to do something but they're not sure what. The people at the top are absurdly over-compensated and they don't spread it out as much as they could and should -- more employee ownership would be a great step. The people on the ""inside"" of the fund management shop, the core business, seem insulated and out of touch, kind of like a bunch of Roman senators.",7

During this time of unprecedented change, it seems the place has become even more political and bureaucratic. Personally, I think Rodger Lawson is a much needed shot-in-the-arm for the company and has done much to infuse new leadership at the top. However, the next few levels down are in turmoil and disarray. Political infighting, turf wars, back-stabbing...it couldn't be further from the goals and objectives that Rodger laid out when he arrived at Fidelity. I think he would be stunned if he knew the truth about how some of his senior leaders were making decisions during the recent waves of layoffs, how good (but ""non political"") talent was being purged from the company, how things were being done more for ""optics"" than actual results. There are still many S and E level VPs in the company that need to find some religion...or seek other pastures.",7
BEWARE!!,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW40561033.htm,1.0,"Jan 12, 2021",Anonymous,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Durham, NC",Pros,They allowed workers to work from home.,Cons,"Where do I start? I spent a decent amount of time working at Fidelity. Overall, I would say it’s not a great company to work for at all. From my observations, many people have gotten stuck in this company, and it’s drained the life/soul out of them. For starts, many full-time and contractors (Fidelity TalentSource) are underpaid for the amount of responsibility on them. Many people are very unhappy here, but their soul has been trapped here way too long. They don’t know how to leave; all they know to do is stay around and complain.

Racism is obvious in this company. After the murder of George Floyd and many others, there was a lot of lip service from upper-level leaders and money donated to non-profits, but the core of this company has not changed at all. It’s racist!

Human Resources and Recruiters for the most part are awful. I think this is one of the MANY reasons why they don’t attract quality candidates, let alone keep them exceptionally long. Speaking of that, turnover is HIGH.

The leadership is really what makes or breaks an organization. The leadership here is awful. I met with a Senior Leader about issues with a product that they oversaw, and they admitted it was problematic and had obvious issues. However, since our meeting nothing about the product has improved, it’s only gotten worst. Do companies think by ignoring constant issues/problems that they’re just going to float away?

I conclude by saying, proceed with caution. Don’t let the nice buildings, benefits, etc. fool you. Once you get in, you will soon realize it was a BIG mistake coming here. You deserve better in life, STAY AWAY!!",19

Management will talk trash about you after you leave, there is no loyalty.

The lack in accountability of its managers isn't unique to Fidelity. Yet, it's disappointing considering it sincerely strives to standby things it espouses. Everyone knows who these bad actors and bad apples are. Members of their teams can't move away fast enough to other teams, departments, or companies. 

Though the company allows them to punish or push out struggling yet sincere frontline employees, it does little to recognize that these ineffective managers are better at managing up to their bosses than lifting up their teams.

You have to have a very thick skin and be willing to stand your ground in the face of some rude treatment. The environment can be quite stressful and some department management seems almost proud of the level of stress. When interviewing be sure to ask about the group's culture rather than the whole company's culture. Performance reviews can be problematic with some management teams.

You work closely with your manager and they'll try to find the best role for you. Ie, if you want to work more on front end(html/css/angular), they'll try to find the best role for you. 

Trust me, as a recent college graduate, this program is unreal. It truly is a gateway to success for your Software Engineering career. It helps you get your feet wet, and feel the least bit comfortable to get off to a good start.

Fidelity tries to make it seem like their is ""a ton of career growth"", but really it is just customer service phone job after customer service phone job.

They move you around to different departments to make it seem like you are being ""promoted"", but really it is the same old crap.

I worked in the Stock Plan Service group in SLC, and was excited to find a career path I was interested in.... Only to find out that Fidelity's generous $10k per year tuition reimbursement policy doesn't apply to you getting THE ONE CERTIFICATION THAT IS 100% applicable to your job. 

You wanna know why? Because everyone who gets it leaves for way higher paying jobs elsewhere. Of course, Fidelity will never tell you that's the real reason.

As soon as I found that out, I started shooting my resume out to competitors in the industry. I easily received multiple offers, off the phone, for way more money. I suggest you do the same!

Oh, and Fidelity does this really cool thing called ""loans"". Basically they promote you to a higher position, give you more work and responsibility but don't pay you any more money. How generous of them, right?",6

- Compensation seems to be appropriate for entry level jobs but does not keep pace as you do move through the company

On the tech side PI is one of the most modern whereas FI is stuck in the early 1990s. My group is excellent and for Fidelity we are on the cutting edge. Work life balance is great - in general the management is very flexible. There are politics but a good manager will shield the developer from this. If you can prove your valuable by innovating Fidelity will take notice - if you do nothing new then you will stagnate. Base compensation is on the lower end of what a developer could make elsewhere but the wide array of benefits, especially the contributions to 401k (7% match and generally 10% profit sharing) are unheard of. Senior management seems to have a clear vision of what they want but the execution on it by middle management is variable.",Cons,"So much of Fidelity's tech is old and maintaining, enhancing the existing systems and building new capabilities requires lots of investment which up until the year the company had been pouring money into. In my opinion some of this money was wasted on buying expensive vendor products from the likes of IBM and Oracle that could have been done without paying for a license.

Lots to learn. Can be a good place to establish a career.,Cons,Fidelity was a great place to work in the 90s but that's all changed. There has been a great deal of pressure on the employees since at least 2003 to perform. Review ratings are absurd. You can literally perform with absolute excellence all year and still be rated average...after all the managers are all under pressure to meet the numbers and submit ratings within the allotted quotas. So...it the whole department had a banner year don't think the whole department is rewarded...this would never happen and it's grossly unfair. You're expected to suck it up and move on...until the next layoff then you're gone. Who needs that!!!,3

Also their new hire training teaches the fundamentals of their systems, they dont teach anything stock related, the closest thing you'll get to learning how markets work is through the series 7 exam and talking with colleagues, but even they are somewhat clueless.

In terms of the people in call centers and computer programming roles, well it is probably tough to stick out from the thousands of other people, but it is still a great company and they don't really expect too much of you from a performance standpoint so why complain about it.

- Not a very friendly place for older workers. The benefits and HR strategy focus on making Millenials happy while managing out older employees.  Fidelity is a great place to start your career.
- Privately held company - Since management isn't exposed to Wall Street pressure, they are slow to change.  For example, Fidelity has been a slow follower in developing online trading, launching an ETF business, creating passive investment products, and developing a robo-advisor.  The company is not innovative. It seeks to copy initiatives from other successful companies.

Inefficiency was literally built into the design review process; I had to run every finished design by a designer--a Fidelity veteran, natch--who might have half my skill level, despite their years of experience. I left because I knew that I wouldn't learn anything there, and my skills would inevitably get stale in an environment that lacked innovation. The management was just getting excited about Flash at the time, at the moment when the industry was moving toward abandoning it! Additionally, diversity was a problem.

The elephant in the room is that they have good products but we are constantly forced to push PAS which is their worst product.

I don't think Abby really has control over some of her subordinates. Site management changed every year that I was there, adding to the confusion. Team managers have entirely too much power and there is very little recourse given to appeal their decisions or seek redress of grievances when they act in an inappropriate manner. The pay is well below industry standards and while you are able to make lateral movements within the company, moving up is EXTREMELY difficult. Pay raises rarely keep up with inflation and while I was there our variable comp was changed making it impossible for anyone to meet the new standards. My pay went down a couple of thousand dollars per year as a result. HR is not responsive and negligent at times. I went an entire year without insurance because I was somehow disenrolled in the plan that I signed up for when I got hired on. HR knew that this mistake had happened and it was documented in their system, but they didn't do anything in time to correct the problem despite my contant pressuring them.

Fidelity has multiple locations so there is potential to move around.  You can get in contact with the top easier than you'd think for a large corporation.  The old saying was you never get rich while at Fidelity, but because you worked there you will be rich.  I think this is true because of the incentive programs between annual bonus opportunities which can be a substantial amount of your income, phantom share program that pay out every two years and their profit sharing that was their year in and out.",Cons,"I thought that Fidelity got a little too big and struggled to find out how to structure itself to succeed.  It seemed like we would go through 3-4 organizational alignments each year.  It's not that it's bad, but they never seem to be able to stay the course with their decisions.  It really depended upon who was leading the charge.  Current senior management is more about the bottom line as oppose to prior leadership.  Prior leadership still looked at growth opportunities and current leadership wants to maintain and not necessary grow the business unless it is an EXACT fit or match.",

This used to be a 'desirable' destination, with the potential to advance one's career.  No more.  They care less about the front-line folks helping clients, and more about 'stats.'  Your breaks are timed/measured, the length of your calls is measured (long calls = baaaaaad,) and getting promoted outside of the department takes an act of congress.
Management, in general, is a bunch of glad-handing guys and gals.  You seldom see managers let go/demoted, even if they are consistently poor performers/coaches.  This leads to a lot of stagnation, and little room for advancement (unless my manager would take the initiative to seek a different role or retire, which hasn't happened in the 5+ years I have been there.)",2

Your skills and experience mean very little when it comes to advancement.  To get ahead you just need to be friends with the right people.  It matter more who you play golf or poker with than what your experience or expertise is.  And it's starting to show in the quality of the firm.  As is the compartmentalization of duties and leaving major decisions to each units management team with very little oversight.

The call center should have a more regular office-like environment and employees should be able to take their time with customer cases-- including necessary off-the-phone time (such as faxing, e-mailing, and account maintenance) without having to jump through hoops to do so.
The customers can be difficult to deal with and really unkind. Most people will be reasonable, but each day there are bound to be at least a few calls in which people are truly frustrated and you just have to have a thick skin about it or find another job.
Like with any job, there is always one manager who is very difficult to deal with. In the case of where I worked, this team manager ended up making the majority of her team quit because of her attitude. I'm lucky that I was placed with one of the other, excellent managers instead of her.",4

Due to cost cutting, departments are not budgeted fully (over the past 10 years or so) and goals of individual departments are not aligned to the corporate goals (except when it comes to cutting costs).

If you want a job outside of the field you are in you have to wait a year to get to a different sector.
There are so many goals they want done on every call, you have to maintain a relationship with the caller, ask protruding personal questions of why they want to take out money out of THEIR 401ks, you have to get a guidance opportunity in where you feel like a seller, you have to get a PCC in where you talk about how much they are putting in their 401k...etc, etc. the list goes on, you have to get so much done in one call, every call.",6

Senior management changes frequently and with those changes is always a reorganization and change of strategy. Fidelity chose RTP in NC as the home for their $100  million dollar new facility and planned to add 2000 + jobs. They started off strong - bought the land, moved hundreds of folks down from Boston and then pulled the plug and decided they would rather operate in TX and other parts of MA. With hundreds of families making a committment to relocate for the company, leaving family, selling their homes in a bad housing market and taking losses on the moves and home sales - most that relocated were laid off before their 1st year finished in the 'new' location. Folks that relocated without a relocation package paid thousands of dollars to get to NC for the company - and the company decided to change strategy and then laid these same 'committed' employees off. Many folks made personal sacrafices for Fidelity - and the company just hung their employees out to dry. Very deceitful company - provides little information to the employees - and what is communicated is mostly not accurate/honest. The culture is highly politicized and very back-stabbing as the company has so many layoffs everyone is always trying to make the other guy look bad in hopes of saving their own position.",11

The size of the company affords a great benefits package, with tuition reimbursement, and a variety of health plans, 401 K etc.   Because the company has so many different areas of business, employees can gain experience in different business units via internal transfers, and grow their career within Fidelity.

The company does not care if you have post graduate degrees--you will not advance for being better educated and prepared then the next guy. Also, the company has this weird mentality to promote women. If you are a woman and want to advance fast, apply here. Management will hire less qualified women over qualified men just because of their gender. I have seen friends who had 3 years experience or more apply for a job, and management will hire a girl who is still going through full trader training.

So basically, when you are given errors for actually helping customers, it comes to a point when the employees just don't care anymore.  Everyone only wants to meet quotas to keep their job.  And this comes at the expense of the clients.  fortunately, I was able to move on to bigger and better things, and have the microscope removed from my rear end.",7

Shortly after, they restructured, brought in the car salesman (ax man) and it has all been down hill from there.

Easy competition for the stack rank. It's fairly new so it isn't micromanaged yet but it is trending that direction. More relaxed than other roles in the phone site.,Cons,The compensation is much less than what it should be for the money you move in and service provided. Confusing bonus structure that is constantly changing and bonus is dictated by manager entirely and not by production and stack rank so it can be very bias. In reality the stack rank is pointless cause 2nd place can get a bigger bonus than 1st. It is starting to become more and more micromanaged. It has become more of an efficiency role instead of quality even though the main point is sales and not service. Very unorganized part of the company. It's a little niche compared to the rest of the company so there is constant change and no one including directors know what's going on in the future. Also misrepresented growth opportunities. They say they are expanding and you can promote to the more prestigious phone role or into the field however when one of those spots is vacated they backfill it with two people in this role instead of replacing.

HR also reminds people that Fidelity only pays 75% of your worth in the Market Place. So the base salaries are quite low.

When I was there, Fidelity implemented a terrible business plan which made service's function more like sales. It was done by making certain metrics, one is evaluated on, excessively high for sales like responsibilities. By the time I left, these metrics had been adjusted to more reasonable numbers. However, the service department still had a major roll in bringing in new money, without any compensation other than miniscule quarterly bonus.

Upper management is extremely patronizing. Though they attempt to cover it up there is very much a culture of ""Mommy/Daddy knows best"" when it comes to making decisions.

There is no time in between calls and you’re pretty much hooked up to the computer all day.

My Manager criticized my calls so much at one point I realized there was nothing I could do to make him happy. Mistakes are to easy to make even if you are laser focused all day. I found a new position and was walked out after putting in my two week notice. They are paying me but i was unable to say goodbye to anyone so it looked like I was terminated after being walked out by my manager which wasn’t the case.

They made it known who they favored and many deserving associates couldn't progress in their roles simply because they weren't favored.  You have to take your breaks and lunches at the exact times they schedule you for (which differed every day) and if you got stuck on a call and went on break late, it would negatively affect your numbers - which ultimately decided your bonus.  This place is a sweatshop.  You are expected to take non stop calls your entire shift.  There is no break in between calls so you aren't even left with time to make notes on the customers accounts you just spoke to - as soon as they hang up, another call immediately comes through with no choice to decline the call.  On average there is at least a 5-10 minute wait  for customers to get through to a representative.  Customers are already aggravated by the time you speak to them - it's like the company sets you up for failure.  They clearly need to hire more people for the role.

Promotion is not based on your CEI and CPH alone, they will promote you if they like you enough. Good luck on getting a manager that you'll get along with, some of them don't care (looking at you Lauren, coming in at 11am and leaving at 3pm), and some are so obsessed with stats that they'll work your until you die. 

Oh you're putting in overtime? That's great, we're expecting you to, who cares if you don't have work/life balance. 

Stay away from this job if you can get anything else. Don't believe it when they tell you 'oh here is a Ping Pong table you get to use', or 'you can sit anywhere you'd like', because they're too cheap to build their own place, and they're overcrowding this office.

If you are very good with Technology no one is likely to ask questions as they wouldn't want to reveal how little they know themselves.,Cons,"Fidelity is very political and top heavy.  Over 25% of IT people have titles of Director or above, however this is not because of ability, it is because it is the only way Fidelity can retain staff.  These people would not cut it at technology companies where engineering and merit are central.

In order to accomplish anything at Fidelity, you must have countless meeting with many groups of people, most of whom will not understand any technical aspects of the discussion.  Instead decision makers will rely on people with inflated titles whom they believe to be technical gurus, but who are simply the best at appearances and politics.

Fidelity is extremely title, appearance, and politics conscious.  Your actual ability to innovate, be creative, or lead is secondary to these factors.  If you are a true lover of technology who wants to learn and grow, then you should make every effort to join a proper technology company.  Avoid Fidelity at all costs.

You basically do everyone’s busy work & you don’t get compensated for it. The role has evolved a lot due to COVID, you’re basically doing the relationship manager role just without the extra pay. I worked in an investor center so you won’t be micromanaged, but it’s hard to do anything when you don’t know what to do. Clients can be hard to work with. If you’re not looking to get into sales don’t even bother. They advertise how quickly you can be promoted within the company but it’s harder than they make it out to be, doesn’t matter how long you’ve been there.",1

I remember the day I got hired as a temp. My world changed, and I was so excited to start my new hire training class. The people at Fidelity are top notch from the security guards, to the cleaning crew, to the executives. This company is ridiculously good at finding the right people who fit the culture and help others grow.

My manager had flexibility where required, and demanded excellence where necessary. I was never unsure of expectations because of the constant feedback loop, and I always strived to do the best work possible because of it. In my group, we had executive leadership involved as well, and even though I was a lower level employee, they were fun, respectful, and always treated me like part of a very important team. I couldn't have asked for more from Fidelity, and I was sad to leave.",Cons,I honestly never had any issues here that weren't my own fault (and I had a few for sure).,1

Not sure why, we're swamped with work and the company continues to make a ton of money.  That is a good thing, but they need to cut in certain 'other' areas instead of the same area every year.  Some of the old leadership must go.  The new leadership I believe is strong.   Maybe they will help breakdown the walls between the groups so we can get a lot of work accomplished.  They also need to get rid of the 'good old boy network'...there's a lot of talent in the organization, but they can't get passed the 'clicks'.  This is very unfortunate.",1

This can make for a challenging work environment.  Processes to get day to day work completed are often cumbersome and inefficient.  Decision making is often decentralized and requires buy-in from many different organizations.  Strategic decisions seem to take excessively long and sometimes waffle back and forth.

If you're looking to work on the most cutting edge technology or explore ways to disrupt industries, maybe it isn't the best place to work.

However you are held to perfectionist standards with exacting measure. My department was constantly reorganizing and for several days in a row no one was quite sure what their job parameters or management was. Needless to say many people are leaving and they are not filling their spots. The poor people left are taking on the slack.

It is a private company, so they can run the business whatever way they want, without any pressure from the public in regards to diversity and inclusion. In interview, they often tell you that the median pay for FC is around 165k, with many earn above 200k. The base is about 45k, most people get paid around the base.

The best technology I have used in the Finance industry.
401(k) matching is among the best in the industry, but annual salary is not competitive.
Good work/life balance.
Team outings each quarter.",Cons,"The call volume is ridiculous, and you spend most of your time resetting passwords, even once you are on the full-trader gate.
Fidelity talks a lot about career development, but team meetings and one-on-one coaching sessions with your manager are constantly canceled due to call volume.  A manager cannot develop his/her employees without ever speaking with them.
Even when you are promoted you do not get a raise, you get an increase in variable comp, and that is determined by whether you hit your metrics.  You can get a ""promotion"" without ever getting a ""raise"".
Management is hit-or-miss.  I worked for a couple of amazing, hands-on managers who were very engaged with their teams. I also worked for a few managers that appeared to do nothing other than sit around and play games on their phones all day.
A lot of push-back from different departments when you try to transfer calls.
Metrics are constantly changing.  What is important one quarter may be meaningless the next quarter.  It makes it very difficult to try to establish a routine on your calls when you don't know what measurements your bonus will be based on.
This is a call center job.  Don't try to kid yourself, you will be on the phones 8 hrs/day.  Unless you get a position in a branch, you will be on the phones, even if you are ""promoted"" to another role.",14

The family and the company goes to great length to ensure we have the best facilities for our teams.  Our major corporate campuses are spread across the country in beautiful locations.  While Fidelity is a conservative company, they build our buildings to last centuries and the are constantly refreshing them.  

I have read many posts about the call center environments.  I felt compelled to respond.  Call centers with any company are tough.  There is no way around it, it is a tough job.  However, it is an entry level position where you can learn a lot in and then leverage that learning to different roles in the future.  I know of 5 Executive Vice Presidents, several SVPs, and VPs who started in the same positions at the firm.  If you are coming out of college, you will likely start in an entry level position at some firm and you will have plenty of opportunities to work up and sideways from there.   

The firm could do a better job of facilitating that movement, but I will mention it further in the ""cons"" section.",Cons,"Career counseling: 
Many of us were told early in our career that you needed to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps when it comes to career planning. Essentially meaning, the cream will rise to the top, and the driven folks will figure it out. 

While there is merit in this strategy,it is outdated for the size of our company.  Like many companies of our size it can become difficult to navigate.  I feel that is why many of the comments on glassdoor related to this topic are correct from the perspective of the person writing the review.  However, this is absolutely not the intention of senior leadership.  The leadership team wants to hire college grads and watch them progress out of entry level positions and branch out throughout the business.  The individuals who do, are generally immensely successful.  

The problem lies in the lack of programmatic career planning conversations and marketing of the internal opportunities and job matching. To their credit, the firm has recognized this issue and I have heard is working on building career centers to help facilitate these dialogues and career plans.  I would expect comments related to issue to start to subside as this rolls out. 

To make a long story short, the sr. team has shown that they care and want to help find the solution.

HR systems and training:
Simply put, we have antiquated systems in HR, and training needs to be modernized to adapt to the way college grads learn.  A better mix of classroom training integrated with a lacking digital solution that ties to our HR systems. 

HR system and staffing:
HR needs an overhaul.  Specifically in staffing.  We have a very traditional model and staffing and HR are loaded with career HR and staffing people.  We need to take a cue from Silicon Valley companies and add more business consultants and business leaders to the HR function to modernize it.  We need to keep about a 1/3 of this business unit as traditional HR and Staffing consultants, but there is a serious lack of creativity and challenge of old processes because of the the similar backgrounds of everyone in the group.  Until we do, we are destined to be average in this space.",10

Benefits are very good. Pay is a little less at Fidelity but when you consider benefits in the compensation package it is competitive.

Workplace environment is reasonably professional and not stuffy.

For the most part front-line managers are willing to work with associates to find a favorable resolution to personal issues.

Managers don't throw you under the bus to customers just to make the customer feel better about a problem.

There are some great employees and managers who care about the customer and care about the employees.",Cons,"Middle and upper management appears to have no idea where they are trying to steer the company, so the company swings from taking an idea to the extreme to a complete 180. Today they may be focusing on customer satisfaction and personalizing the interaction and in a few months decide to strip down customer interactions to scripted nonsense.

There are very few outlets for good ideas to arrive at implementation. Although there are feedback channels that may from time to time result in small changes, the bigger process issues or customer/client issues are completely controlled from the top by people who don't understand (and at times take pride in not knowing) what they manage so they don't know how to recognize or fix problems. So something may be a problem for years before somebody decides to do something about it, and even then the ""solution"" may aggravate the problem.

Fidelity is very political. Fidelity is obsessed today with it's brand image to the public, but one thing that is always constant at Fidelity is the constant obsession about your ""brand"". Gossip is taken as gospel and can ruin your brand in a second. What people have to say about you will override your performance in virtually all cases. Many managers would rather sink one of their employee's opportunity for advancement to be able to keep that person's performance in their numbers. A lot of backstabbing and stealing credit occurs.

There's not a lot of advancement opportunity. When the economy was great in 2007 it wasn't that hard. If you were great in your job, you could move on to a slightly better position, and when you did well there, you could move to another slightly improved position, until you were where you wanted to be. Once the economy crashed in 2008 that all stopped. I get it. That happened everywhere. However, it also stopped all discussions of professional development and no effort was made to give opportunities to develop skills for the current role or another. As a result, future promotion will be very difficult because internal candidates won't be as competitive against external candidates.

Recruiting/HR and their processes are absurd. It can take months after applying for a position before you get an interview. You can apply for a role, not hear anything for several months, and then get an email that you have an interview the next day. So you end up with no opportunity to prepare and made no efforts to prepare because you never heard anything back. Feedback from interviews rarely exists or is very generic. Hiring managers are lazy and don't follow through. 

For every great manager there are ten clueless unhelpful managers. It's obvious that middle and upper management have no idea how to manage their people because there's very little accountability or responsibility on the part of front-line managers. Directors believe yelling at people is the only way to manage, so they will yell at their managers when the numbers are bad, and that's pretty much the extent of direction or vision executed at the management level. I have heard several managers complain that they don't feel it's right that their performance is judged based on the performance of the people they manage. Well, that's what managers are there to do. If they aren't managing towards success, then they aren't doing a great job. I understand there are low performers, etc. but when I see managers playing ping pong for hours in the break room, there's not a lot of accountability in the system.

There's a lot of infighting between different business units. Everybody points fingers but nobody takes ownership over problems and fixes them. Customers and employees get stuck in the middle with no way to get out.

Fidelity no longer places a premium on its talent. Since 2008 the company has eliminated whole business groups with no effort to keep around people with tenure with tremendous transferrable skills. It does very little to help grow talent or keep it from leaving. Where a few years ago employees were loyal to the company and that loyalty was returned, the company has completely eliminated that loyalty. As a result, the company keeps losing great talent and keeps hiring new people who underperform and embarass those of us who strive to be great at our jobs. 

While all of the above things are common among businesses and I have, as most people, experienced similar trends at other jobs, what I will point out is that these problems were not institutionalized in a company that performs with mediocrity and accepts laziness in its overall perforamce. Fidelity is a top competitior in its markets and a lot of its strength historically came from the loyalty to and from its employees. Fidelity has worked very hard to treat its employees with indifference and management -- from the very top -- has set the company afloat with no real vision or guidance other than keep trying to make things that don't work struggle to work.",17

Good brand recognition from customers, but this can turn into a negative if you lack humility.  Most reps are not as good as you think.  The green machine is doing a lot of the heavy lifting, but those who are good at building value and relationships can transfer those skills to an RIA and do really well.",Cons,"- Although micro-management is mentioned in almost every review, I think it stems from not trusting your veteran representatives.  Fidelity feels like they have to control people from the top, having branch managers regurgitate sentiments from the top.  This also leads to *bleep* rolling downhill.  Some managers did prove themselves as good salespeople, but eventually have to drink the Kool-Aid or they won't last long.  Either that or they give up because they can't change the system.  Other managers were opportunists who rose through the ranks quickly, moving fast enough before people can realize they aren't as good as they appeared.

- Compensation:  Yes, you can make very good money here, but if you're really good, you can make way more outside.  Compensation is figured out ahead of time and they reverse-engineer the compensation plan to get AE's back to target comp.  The last couple of years, they've reduced some of the pay, like basis points on new flows, coinciding with the S&P at historical highs.  Oddly enough, they had a reduction in force in 2009 because they based payroll on the S&P and had to cut people.  So when the market's down, you're screwed, and when the market's up, you're also screwed.  Ultimately, you can't keep lying about AE/SAEs being in relationship roles when your compensation is still based on selling products.  And this relationship model is 5 years old.",17

I have made several life-long friends and look forward to seeing them every day. Asking around you will find many people also found their significant others at work as well.

2 ~ Upward mobility and job opportunities. I may be biased from working at the Westlake campus where there are over 6000 jobs but it is also relatively easy to move to other locations within the company. There was a time years ago when it might have felt like you had to go to Boston to move up in the company but those days are gone and there are many great leadership positions throughout the country.

3 ~ Brand recognition you can be proud of and sleep well at night. Fidelity is a discount broker so not ripping people off with high loads or fees. They did not get caught up in the mischief so many other firms did with the mutual fund scandals or financial crisis.",Cons,"The best things about Fidelity are also the worst things about Fidelity. 

1 ~ If you end up in the wrong department with the wrong boss your life can be a living hell. Fidelity is very liberal in its HR policies which can be good but also means they let things fester for a long time before taking action. There is a percentage of people that will take advantage of this and especially if you are on a small team you may end up constantly covering for a weak link.

2 ~ It is an American dream to start in the mail room and work your way up to VP someday and that is totally possible at Fidelity. In fact, it may be a bit too easy. It is completely common to attend leadership meetings and hear from senior executives ""I started on the phones just like you!""  Well, that is fine once in a while but at some point you do want people leading you to actually have some training and experience. Fidelity is full of hundreds maybe thousands of Directors, VP's and SVP's that started on the phone ""just like you"" and it shows.

3 ~ Fidelity has managed to stay out of the news but there are plenty of unsavory things they do behind the scenes. They are currently very worried about the Department of Labor proposed Fiduciary Rule. Their current employer benefits business model is already unethical but if the rule is enacted will be illegal as well. It has long been a major IRA rollover sales lead source to take advantage of relationships with employers to gain access to employees. Fidelity is the world's largest 401k record-keeper and should this lead source be taken away it will be a huge hit to their personal investing sales model in which two thirds of the new assets are from internal rollovers. The Fidelity brokerage business would be nowhere near what it is today without having taken advantage of these workplace business relationships.",17

It's a stepping stone at best.,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW8758551.htm,2.0,"Nov 27, 2015",Financial Services Representative,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Jacksonville, FL",Pros,"Fidelity has an incredibly in-depth four month long training program that will not only bring pre-licensed financial representatives up to speed to pass their Series 7 and 63's (even for those completely new to the industry), but will also familiarize you with all of the software that would be used on a day-to-day basis. Generally speaking, upon completion of the program, financial representatives are capable of adequately performing the job duties in what is objectively a complicated job function without any sort of assistance. Also, barring a layoff climate or doing anything illegal, job security is very, very high; never hitting your numbers will still get you your weekly paycheck. If you play the game, opportunity is most certainly there to advance (and your manager will be first in line to assist you in achieving your goals), but you can only go so far in the call center, both in terms of job duties and salary.",Cons,"Unfortunately, the training program is where my positive experience ended. Employees are reminded every day from the first time they peruse the careers website, to the job interview, to on-boarding, to training, to team meetings, that Fidelity isn't like Merrill Lynch, Schwab, JP Morgan, or any other player in the game; Fidelity is a family-owned company and doesn't have to play to it's shareholders, and thus they are one of the few in the business ""for the customer"". That sure sounds nice, but beyond being family-owned, it's just not true. This job is in a 24/7 call center, and just like every call center in the world, metrics are king. You'll never move up anywhere in the company for retaining a multi-million dollar account or preventing perilous actions through education of financial instruments or any other morally outstanding action... you'll move up for finishing your calls on an average of less than eight minutes. This ""time = money"" focus exacerbates an already-beaurocratic business structure by incentivizing representatives to transfer their calls or to be curt to the point of being entirely unhelpful. That's fine, and almost expected from most call center representatives with other companies, but in financial services, it's unacceptable; you're dealing with people's retirement accounts and livelihoods. On the sales side, recommendations are limited to proprietary target-date funds and bloated, high-fee ""managed"" accounts. Going above and beyond to solve problems that are repeatedly surfacing and are consistently unaddressed is a habit discouraged by management: ""that's not your job"". Other than their own propaganda, nothing differentiates this company from the other financial services firms--do not take a potential paycut to choose Fidelity over them with the idea that you'll be working for some sort of Red Cross organization, even though they will spin it that way. At the end of the day, this is a 24/7 call center (where your job is to verify customers, reset passwords, give website support, send checks, and enter trades at their direction...financial professional is thrown around very loosely around Fidelity, but I would not consider the FR to be one) that is ALWAYS hiring. If you weren't able to deduce, there is an unhealthy amount of turnover at Fidelity due to employees leaving for increased responsibilities and salaries (most Jax representatives went to Merrill, which was literally across the street!). On the other hand, if you have some sort of relevant degree or experience and are out of work, there is a ton of job security and experience to be gained here. It's a stepping stone at best.",23

Co-workers are nice. Work is super easy and doesn't take much time if you are smart. Great for coasting into retirement.,Cons,"Not a good place for people who are implied leaders. It's a very top-down culture. You have no budget even as a VP, no freedom to push outside the ""Fidelity way"". Most people have been here for the last 20 years and it shows how out of touch these leaders are with how workforce of today looks at leadership and work in general. Long tenured middle managers and individual contributors also show a strange indentured servitude behavior. Many don't have the spine to say the truth, stand up for their beliefs and do the right thing. The culture is to sugar coat bad news and push all decision making as far up as possible. 

This might be fine if you come from a top-down, command and control culture. If you have worked in a culture of empowerment, this will be a stifling place. 

The company is headed towards uncharted territory but people up top lack the will to get rid of the ""leadership"" crud that only knows status-quo and actively tries to stonewall new ideas. A vast majority started their careers in phone sales - so they are not equipped for todays and tomorrows world. It will be an extremely hard task to correct the current heading of this ship. Drastic measures are needed to clean house but I doubt it will happen. I am waiting to see what happens in the next year.

Again, if you are a young, go-getter this might not be a place for you.  If you want to build a career that enables you to work in another company later, don't count on developing yourself as a leader here. If you want to be told what to do and just want to spend a few more years until retirement, this place is great and has excellent benefits.",14

-management likes to hype up the small things.. like wireless headsets, or taking a break when you want to... but they will pass a long all bad news to the lower level managers and will not face the front line reps at all. They refuse to hear any criticism on policy updates. Some are so far removed from helping any client that it's comical what they expect.
- lately they have been devaluing the high net worth service reps. They used to allow for casework and follow up on issues, but they've tossed that in favor of handling as many clients as possible. So now the client with 2 mill as equal standing as client with 2k.

- Large enough company to move around in and chart a career path

- Pockets of great situations (good leadership, interesting work, challenging opportunities)",Cons,"- Those pockets of great situations are growing fewer and further between each day, the amount of influence one's boss can have on their career at Fidelity is astounding ... in 3 different jobs, I was rewarded (1) on par/average, (2) over-the-top with $$$ and shares and promotions, and (3) not at all .... my approach to the work didn't change in any of those jobs, so it shows that people of equal talent and skills could expect significantly different experiences at this company

 - Jobs are moving out of Boston, so local opportunities are few and far between ... those that pop up are usually pre-reserved for a hiring manager's friend (i.e. probably not the most qualified candidate), so the talent base is watering down, causing animosity, and those that want to advance their career in the Boston-area have to look elsewhere

- There is a layer of lifers at the Director / VP level that have settled into a comfort zone, earning high salaries from the days of raises/big bonuses (long gone), they are staying off the radar, and don't want to rock the boat ... so they are stifling innovation, they are roadblocks to progress, and they are blocking career opportunities for younger, talented, innovative staff members.

- Didn't get a raise in 3 years despite the company pulling in $2.2-2.4B in profit each year, was told it'd be made up to me in the form of a ""higher bonus"", but the bonuses were the same each year.

I can't pay rent, buy food, or pay all the other bills I have will my ""great benefits.""  Money is the only thing that helps with that - and the salaries Fidelity pays, compared to the broader industry, are ridiculously low.  Moreover, there have been numerous changes that have occurred in the last 12 months that are ostensibly to ""make things better"" for the customer, as well as the associate, but the net effect has been the opposite ... for both.  They've basically significantly increased the scope of the role, while narrowing the performance metrics ... all while creating an increasing environment where it essentially makes it impossible for you to provide the positive experience the customer is expecting, and meet your goals.  How this has played out out to associate is ... you can kiss making more than the bare minimum for your quarterly bonuses (which also ... in not very much at all) goodbye.  Also, over the last 12 months or so, there seems to have been a dramatic concern with turnover, primarily among the associates who have been with the company less than 12 months.  The company has become ridiculously preoccupied with finding ways to keep this demographic with the company that they're basically throwing everything but the kitchen sink at them in the misguided hope it will keep them from leaving.  Basically ... they're focusing all their measures on increasing salary, compensation, and quality at work to the employees who have been there the least, and contribute the least to the company's overall functionality.  I've been with the company, and in this function for years, and even though I've been given yearly bonuses and increases I sit next to people who have been licensed less than 6 months, and are making the same amount in salary as me, or more.  It's really insulting, not to mention makes all the experienced, and seasoned employees feel extremely unappreciated.  Then there's also the issue that performance and ability really have no bearing whatsoever towards promotions or recognition for achievement - the current situation at the location where I work reminds me more of my senior year of high school, and everything boils down to a popularity contest.  The end result is you have people who weren't even competent to begin with and routinely failed to meet even the most basic of their performance metrics, being given increased levels of responsibility and management if they're ""popular.""  Granted this exists to some degree or another no matter where you work, however the level I've witnessed over the years is on the order of 20 times worse than anything I've experienced in nearly 15+ years in the workforce.",10

3) Assuming 1 and 2 above, Financial Consultant role is too much of a grind to be a career. You either spend 2-5 years there and then move into management or you burn out and leave.

Advisers have 300-1000+ households and there is no meaningful compensation for retention of assets given the book sizes. ($40k year for a $200 mil managed money book? - book generates $1.5 - $2 mil annual revenue and you give the adviser $40k?)

Vast majority of your comp is tied to annual sales and what you have done in the past means nothing. Therefore clients that have a plan and 100% wallet share are undesirable.

Since company is so large and has so many clients they need to fill the chairs with advisers quickly. Many advisers are 20 and 30 somethings with little or no background in finance, they do the bare minimum for planning and only want to sell products and managed accounts. There is little incentive to really deliver a sound plan because that actually takes time and who has time with 1000 clients?

Overall - the reality is Fidelity is good for “mass affluent” financial help but they are too big and cookie cutter to truly help people with more than  $3-$5 mil. Due to size they have to reduce services to lowest common denominator to ensure consistency.",10

The rest just push buttons and fake it. 
If you took 1-2 finance classes in college you will probably learn nothing new to help you in the industry. The monitoring and problem solving skills learned are 100% based on troubleshooting of departmental chaotic/confused processes of using excel and/or internal softwares. 
Managers don't (mostly) have any managerial skills or passion to manage and do so in order to climb the latter. In reality, they are analysts who stayed at Fidelity the longest (or when everybody else left after 2-3 years). 
Those who leave (which is almost all employees except managers) do so after realizing they will never be able to support an adult life/family with the low pay (including all ""unique benefits""). 

In conclusion, 
To demonstrate the shortsightedness and focus on internal computer troubleshooting I will use this fact: Most managers and directors can tell you a lot about how to find a variance due to miscalculation of an Excel's spreadsheet formula but no very little to nothing about the stock market, bond market, and most importantly the nature of mutual fund investing.

The benefits, training, and exposure to the financial markets are invaluable. For those wanting to enter the industry that do not have degrees from overpriced private colleges, Fidelity is the place to be. You will work alongside some of the best and the brightest, ambitious individuals who come from a wide array of backgrounds, all sharing a common desire to help the uneducated investor find success.

I can only speak for the Jacksonville, FL location, but the training is phenomenal. The series 7 instructors, alongside the rest of the learning and development team will make sure you are successful. You will have to be self motivated though, every day during the initial training you will be coming home to take 1-3 hour tests, but if you ever need assistance with a concept the mentors are there for you - and are actually encouraged to help you by being paid overtime.

Benefits are amazing. Make sure you take advantage of everything.

With the brand new systems in place, schedules are more flexible!",Cons,"If you want to go to a role involving financial analysis, or anything unrelated to the direct relationship with the clients, it is almost impossible to do starting from the phone roles, you will easily get a job at another firm with the training and certifications you gain, so you may have to jump around from firm to firm.

The advisory/guidance roles in Fidelity are less ""sales"" related in comparison to say Merrill Lynch, but they are still sales related. At the end of the month if you did not speak with a single customer that needed an annuity, you should not see any form of negative impact for not putting someone in one. Fidelity should be leading the industry in the charge towards a more ""fiduciary"" standard.

The compensation was recently increased to 42k for the entry level, which is okay, but honestly everyone across the board should receive about an extra ~10k. Fidelity can afford to do it, and the retention rates would drastically increase. Most of the employees are recent college graduates, so amazing healthcare and benefits are not as important as cash money to invest.",5

A 529 plan allows individuals to save money for a beneficiary by contributing up to $14,000 (or $28,000 if married and filing jointly) annually without incurring gift or generation-skipping transfer tax liability. Earnings in this plan grow federal income tax-deferred and the distributions are federal income tax-free as long as they are used for qualified higher education expenses. There may be additional state tax benefits to participants, contingent on their state’s tax regulations. 

Nepotism
Who you know can get you a job
If your manager doesn't like you, it's going to be nearly impossible to move up in the company
Last year they bumped up the new hire pay by I think $5,000 to get more people interested in applying, but none of the pre-existing employees have gotten any type of compensation adjustments to make up for it
The annual salary review (and usual salary increase) is being pushed back this year, so that it's a year and a half from our last increase
Don't get settled into what your role is defined as, because it'll most likely change without your opinion being considered
Everything is going full-blown sales - they push a ""customer first"" attitude, but all of the compensation and management feedback is exactly the opposite
We used to be able to take time to do research and follow up on our clients' needs, but they're punishing us for taking the time to ensure our customers have good experiences because we're not constantly taking phone calls/chats/emails etc.
The only things that our bonuses are really based on are how many interactions we're taking per hour, how many sales leads we can get, and then our customer feedback survey scores - but they keep lowering the amount of impact the feedback surveys have... it seems like they're caring less and less about the customer's experience, and more and more about how much money they're making (to be honest, it's a dog-eat-dog world out there for investment firms right now though)",9

2. (not a con for me but could be for others) this place will demand your very best every day. If you are afraid of a challenge and would rather be chill and relaxed please don't apply.
3. The associate focused culture stops at the front line associates. From there up it is all about results and there is substantial pressure to deliver. 
4. at a certain level in management ""promotions"" are not achievable. You are given a laundry list of personal characteristics  that you need to develop. You are told to get a masters degree. Once you achieve these grand goals; a promotion is not ""guaranteed"". you need to wait for a manager above you to retire or get promoted. Then the promotion process is done as a round table discussion of your senior directors/vps. So even if you fill all the requirements for a promotion it still comes down to advocacy.

The benefits in terms of insurance coverage is decent. On the surface their retirement plan looks good with all the match and profit sharing, but their vesting schedule is draconian and traps you working for them for YEARS before you would ever get to take any of their retirement contributions with you when you leave. And you will want to leave quickly.",Cons,"Metrics. Matrices. Benchmarks. Expectations. Goals.
Forget Fidelity being a Finance company. Their business, what they do best, is perfecting the art of micromanagement. Think you've learned how to do your job effectively? Think again. Every few months they've designed or redesigned a new system for you to learn to use because it is NEW AND IMPROVED with many more reporting features to keep an eagle eye on every single insignificant facet of your job performance - all in the name of assigning a number and a statistic to what you do that they can then set the goal for just high enough that they can use your performance as a reason to short you on a bonus or deny you a raise.
And they have no sympathy for their front line workers being abused on the phones either. They cleared out their offices and sent everyone home in March, but everything else has been business as usual ever since. No changes in expectations even an inch even though everybody in the trenches has been putting up with 3-4x the work they were doing 100 days ago. No guaranteed bonuses. No time off availability. Overtime has been expected and mandatory from the beginning, otherwise you're labeled as ""not a team player"" and ""hurt your Fidelity Brand""

As long as I work 40 hours in a week and make a certain number of calls a day, I can show up at 7 AM or 10 AM. (This is uncommon throughout the company)

Time off: Fidelity starts at 18 days of paid time off per year.  After two years, it is bumped to 23. I love this. It's higher than what a lot of companies offer people with years of experience - at Fidelity it is standard. The negative, however, is that this PTO encompasses all personal time - you don't get any sick/personal/voluntary time off in addition to your PTO. (Excluding federal requirements, maternity, etc.)
Benefits: Fidelity will pay up to $10k in student loan debt over the course of 5 years ($2k a year, or $167 a month.) They'll also reimburse you (you pay up front) 90% of college tuition/coursework costs, up to $10k a year. I am taking advantage of both these programs.
Advancement: Fidelity is not a meritocracy and you cannot move up just by doing your job well and going home at 5. That being said, there is a 'Fidelity way' of doing things, it's pretty simple, and only requires a little bit of off the clock time. In addition, I've never met anyone that won't tell you what their job is or how they got there. Upper management is easily accessible and they often participate in career coaching or mentorship sessions/programs. 
401k benefits: After one year of service, Fidelity will match you dollar for dollar up to 7% of your paycheck. Also, profit sharing at year end can be 10% of your annual salary deposited one time to your 401k. (10+7= 17% of your salary for free to your 401k.)

I don't have much experience to compare these to other firms.

They will tell you there is no “mandatory” overtime but there is and if you opt out of it you will get nasty messages. Bonuses are based off of call surveys which sometimes you will get a bad survey that wasn’t even from a call you took and there’s nothing you can do about it. Even if you move to another product you will still be overloaded with 401k calls. If you have to go to the bathroom and it’s not during a break or lunch it counts against you. If you don’t plan your days off at least a month in advanced it counts against you. There are more things that count against you then for you. The environment has gotten really bad lately and you can feel it when you walk in the door. Fidelity throws benefits at you but then doesn’t bother to check in on the call center.

Emerging Leader Program,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW29278867.htm,3.0,"Sep 17, 2019","Associate, Emerging Leader Program","Current Employee, more than 1 year","Boston, MA",Pros,"Fidelity at large is a good company to start your career in, there are great people at the firm always willing to lend a hand and offer career help and connections. Different from other financial services companies, Fidelity doesn't work its employees all day and night so you'll have a social life and get sleep.

I joined Fidelity after college as a part of the Emerging Leader Program - a new 18-month rotational program for college graduates based in New England.  The program pros are: 
- Exposure to senior leadership: many 1:1's with VP's, SVP's and executives once in a while
- Opportunity to travel: ad hoc and there is a trip ELP plans to tour the different Fidelity sites
 - Working new jobs/roles: you won't get bored for too long since you are rotating every few months 
- Comradery:  You do the program with other new college grads and you build a great comradery and makes the experience fun as well as gives you great new friends. 
- Connections: different from networking, you will meet great individuals along the path that will be sincerely great mentors, rotational managers, and friends at the firm.",Cons,"Though the Emerging Leader Program was designed to allow liberal arts graduates to learn about financial services in an ""elite"" program, it has its severe downfalls and ultimately I do not recommend this program to anyone considering starting their career with ELP. My cons are as follows: 

- Commuting: for New England based associates, you are expected to travel to your assigned rotations in either RI, NH, or Boston. These assignments are chosen subjectively by your manager, and you do not know up until 3 or so weeks before your rotation begins. Though you can express interest in rotations that are based in Boston, NOTHING is ever certain or clear, you may be left surprised at your unsatisfying assignment. Not everyone in the program will get assigned a rotation that requires 2+ hours of driving so you may be a part of the unlucky few that is left to drive into the woods for a dark 4 months. You cannot log your miles driven so you do not get reimbursement for gas, the low compensation does not help  cushion the cost either.

- Rotation assignments:  The program  gives associates three 4-month long rotations in different business units within fidelity. If you have an interest in a certain group - finance, strategy, personal investing, etc. there is no certainty that you will be able to work with them as the rotations are assigned by topics - operations, product, and data analytics (which they don't even stick to half the time so it's unorganized). The way these are assigned are subjectively your manager who you share your interests with but they ultimately decide where you will go. You may be left unhappy and confused at what you are assigned and the lack of skills developed in 4 months. Management hammers into you to ""trust the process"" but I caution you not to. The lack of structure to how placements are assigned is the single biggest downfall of the program since final placement is correlated to the work experience you have or haven't been able to build in the past 18 months. 

- Compensation: the comp is way too low for an ""elite"" program and compared to similar programs at other firms!!

-  Diversity and Inclusion: though efforts are being made to advanced inclusion in the firm and program at wide, don't expect Fidelity to be as socially aware as your liberal arts college. You'll find people with similar social consciousness but as a firm they still have a ways to go - though sincere efforts are being made, culture changing is slow at a large firm. This lack of D&I inevitably trickles down to ELP management and the decisions made so enjoy :). 

I see the program thriving in 5-10 years when large structural changes have been made (which are being considered to be transparent). 

TO BE CLEAR - most of my feedback is for ELP and not Fidelity at large, there are great parts of the firm that are healthy and great career drivers that I would highly recommend.",8

Others will do what they can to take care of themselves at the cost of others.   The HR rules to not apply to that level and there are known issues that are kind of ignored.  They are hired for driving to metrics and not the ability to manage, lead or inspire. Just do your homework to determine if the leadership of the function will align to what is important to you.

Also understand the bonus opportunity and how it is structured.  Your bonus percent is always immediately reduced by the funding level (fund at 85% for example)  and then you get  a percentage of your bonus eligible amount depending on performance. .85 (funded level)  X .85 (decent bonus based on performance) X.40 (eligible amount) = 28.9% is really what your 40% ""bonus opportunity"" turns out to be. And that is for a solid performer. Just be fully informed as  you negotiate your salary.  80/20 rule applies here -Only 20% get the top bonus which means you actually get the ""opportunity"" tied to your grade level. Don't get me wrong here - is 28% a nice bonus? Yes. Is it far away from 40%? Yes.  What is supposed to be motivating you to perform well just becomes exhausting.",5

Finally, misery loves company - so you'll have some great camaraderie with your fellow employees!",Cons,"I don't know about other call centers in the company - but in ours, they schedule overtime automatically into your schedule then you have to opt out by a specific time otherwise you're expected to work it. People on here keep calling the vacation time ""PTO"" but it's not truly. It's accrued vacation time, max of 4 weeks a year (depending on years of service), and it's use it or lose it (no carry over to next year). The NH call centers are ""triple AAA"" rated, meaning if there is a weather event or crisis in another center, we cover for them if they need to close, and if we have bad weather here - we're still open regardless. In the call center, you have to schedule your vacation time about a year in advance, but they do give you the option to change dates through the year. Vacation date availability is doled based on seniority in your ""gate,"" but to be honest, this is really the most fair way to do it. Just don't expect to have any big holidays off in your first couple of years there is what I'm saying. 

There's little upward mobility. They have a Management Apprenticeship Program, but the people I've seen go into it aren't those that work their tails off - it's those that buddy up to their manager. When you come out of the program, you might go right back to your old position, until a manager position opens up - eventually. Also, on this vein - I started the company working a late second shift, but needed to change to a first shift for personal reasons. My manager at the time was resistant to have me move - not because we were shorthanded on the 2nd shift - he said 1st shift was reserved for those who ""earned"" it, and that it was a ""reward."" Now there are times when people are actually HIRED for 1st shift, so how is that a reward for those who are just hired? Nor am I a lackluster employee. 

As a rep over 6 years, I've probably had 10+ managers - and my position hasn't changed. So it's very hard to know what is expected of you, and to truly succeed. With having so many managers, any goals that I've set with previous managers have gotten lost and I've had to start from the bottom. If you want something for yourself, such as a new position, you better work for it, and work fast. Also, don't ever get comfortable at your cubicle, you will move. Alot. 

If you ever take a Leave of Absence, expect that when you come back, that the call center may have been reorg'd and your position as you knew it when you left is no longer available, and the new position that is taking over may not be offered to you. 

There are no COLA raises. 

Finally, if you ever have a problem with a manager, the burden of proof is entirely on you to prove you are being mistreated somehow. Management sticks with Management, and HR will listen but is more likely to provide ""helpful"" advice for conflict resolution than to step in, unless you're accusing them of a major infraction.",7

Occasionally there is free breakfast and lunches. Room to grow in the company if you are willing to move,Cons,"On the surface the Financial Consultant position seems great. They give you a book of clients, there's no cold calling since they provide leads and you can make over 6 figures with average effort. But in reality it's a pure sales role with very little concern about what's right for the client. Definitely not a fiduciary advisor and the turnover is extremely high.  It's all about selling product and filling the buckets. Fidelity FCs are managed by the ever present spreadsheet. Everyone is stacked ranked and if you are below average on any category your branch manager or RPC ( who are usually inexperienced coaches that stink at sales) will come talk to you to see how to improve. The problem is there are like over 20 categories of things they measure you on. So you will always be below average in something! Another annoying thing is every click on the computer, every phone call, every email is tracked like big brother ! They also continually roll out some new method or spreadsheet and say this is the way things are going to be so get used to it. 4 months later you never hear about that spread sheet again. There is no adjustment if you are new, if you are in different markets or have a smaller or a more established book. There is a certain level of gamesmanship with the numbers too. Click here it counts, click here it doesn't even if you did the work. Talk to a client for like 30 seconds and tag their deposit and you get credit. Drop this client from your book without the client knowing and you won't get hit with an outflow.   The people who do well in the role game the system the best. All the managers are ok with this and all they care about is selling managed money, annuities and bringing in new assets. Who cares what's right for the clients. That's really the sad part the clients think you are helping but in reality you are just selling what pays you the most basis points and hope they never call you after the sale. My advice is if you get this position plan to work it for 2 years then find something else in Fidelity not in the branch network.",11

"If you're looking at the Financial Rep Role, read this.",https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW13147922.htm,2.0,"Dec 30, 2016",Anonymous Employee,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Denver, CO",Pros,"Decent benefits(which they've recently begun to cut back on). It's a mellow work culture, your co-workers are quite friendly and helpful in general, it's not a cutthroat environment at all. You will learn a lot at this job, and they do foster development within the constraints they provide. They're incredibly flexible with scheduling and accommodating for sick days etc, which is a huge plus for me.",Cons,"This pertains specifically to the Denver site, but is also relevant to the role as a whole;


1) In the FR role you're essentially forced to burnout. The efficiency metrics are high, and when you good at the role you will take 70-100 calls a day. If you haven't done this before, you have no idea how exhausting it can be, people are pissy, impatient and dump their problems in your lap every day. Despite having a Series 7, you will quickly learn you're not really a stock broker, you're a frontline customer serviced rep in a call center. I rarely trade, most of my day is spent playing clean up with banking,tech support or paperwork issues while playing damage control with inconvenienced clients. You will quickly learn how insane people can be, you WILL have a client cussing and irrationally berating you because you can't make their check clear on a Sunday. 

2) The career opportunities are narrow, particularly for the Denver site. During training they will tell you that everyone is promoted within 4-5 months, and some promoted out of the training class. This is misleading at best. I'm a top performer in the site and now over a year in role, there are serious issues with favoritism in hiring, I've seen stellar candidates passed over countless times. Even with a promotion, it doesn't change the fact that 90% of jobs are on the phone. It's not easy to be leashed to a phone for 8 hours at a time, there are no projects, or tangible accomplishments, your tasks are often monotonous and dry.

3) There's a massive morale problem in the role, more than half the people I talk to are actively seeking other employment or are despondent and burnt out. If you don't drink the company Kool - Aide 100% (which you never should at any job) you will quickly see a lot of the problems with the business decisions, common practices and client t treatment are frustrating. With this being said, there are people who enjoy the job, and stay in it for years, just be very self aware when you consider the job. 

4) For the licenses, you're underpaid compared to the industry. They justify this by giving you a ""culture"" that is superior. To a degree it's accurate, compared to other phone sites and financial firms, it's pretty decent. 

5) Your central metric, upon which bonuses and promotions are centrally focused, are customer surveys, which are graded irrationally and unfairly. You can correlate higher, but it is largely random, and it can be infuriating.",11

*Voluntary and unpaid days off for when call volumes are low, typically come up during the summer",Cons,"This is a CALL CENTER, you will spend 7.5 hours a day taking INBOUND CALLS for at least half of the year with no breaks in between. They will tell you when you get hired that you can be promoted within a few weeks, that only applies to 1% of employees, and they usually have years experience in the industry. And if you do get promoted, all they do is change your title, give you a very small pay increase, and stick you back on the inbound phone line. Usually takes about 3-5 years to get off the inbound phone line, as most of the non call center positions are filled with external hires. They will give you a list of regular ol' business day schedules before you sign, then change your schedule to something vastly different when you get licenced.The sign in bonus is great, until you find out that you have to stay at Fidelity for more than a year to avoid repayment. It seems like they are using it as a tool to artificially increase retention. This job is VERY monotonous, and you will be burnt out after 4-5 months after completing training. Most people in the office are either trying to get into a position where they aren't on the phones, then applying elsewhere when they find out there are none. Service reps are the front line, so when other groups have meetings and off phone work between calls, you will not. Constantly changing rules about what you can/can't do on the phone, and very little communication about changes.

My experience might not be everyone's. There are a ton of business units and opportunities but it seems most jobs that are posted appear to already have a specific type in mine if not a specific person already, but they go through the motions. When the company makes a push for something they are singularly focused, the push for millennials means you see tons of your people advancing which means older, tenured workers are relegated to associate roles. When the push is to empower women, there are networks, seminars and women helping women, sometimes to the detriment of males, especially if the manager is a woman (this is not a misogynist statement). My demographic, african-american male is the bottom rung of every category it seems. There are few leaders in my part of the country with no Sr. Level leaders that I am aware of on the national level? I've been searching the corporate hierarchy for years, while I don't have time to cycle through all 30-40K employees to try and find one that looks like me, it also shouldn't be that difficult if the company is truly as diverse as it thinks it is. I am not saying affirmative action is needed, I'm saying there has to be some qualified person of color (black) that can advance? I realize advancement is based on merit, but as previously stated merit is not the determining factor, it's who you know or your demographics in the vast majority of decisions. The company would rather invest time, effort, and energy in selecting and grooming a mentee that fits the bill than hiring a more experienced individual and doing the same. If you are over 40, black, male then you can work there, you just can't advance.",7

In the call center positions, you're on a clock, you get the legal minimum required breaktime, and there is a general lack of respect for work/life balance.

Incredible place to learn the industry,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW122507.htm,4.0,"Nov 25, 2008",Licensed Personal Financial Representative,Former Employee,"Covington, KY",Pros,"Fidelity offers outstanding benefits and perks, from fitness and computer reimbursements to solid 401k matching.  The Financial Representative role is highly team-based, and there are always campaigns going on to see which team can land the highest metric scores.  The prizes for performing well in the campaign are often substantial.  It is quite possible to set aside the gift cards you win from the campaigns to fund an entire Christmas shopping list.  A good friend of mine won a 4-day, company paid trip to the Bahamas as a campaign reward.  Plus, the campaigns are a lot of fun.

The team structure is great.  Nearly all of the managers are incredible.  Some are more hands-on than others, but they all make sure you're developing as a representative and getting the training you need to stay sharp.  

During the summer, things were incredibly slow and we were often offered VTO (Voluntary Time Off), meaning we could request to leave at a certain time of day and take the rest of the day unpaid.  While getting addicted to VTO was extremely hazardous to your paycheck, it was cerrtainly nice to have that option, especially during the summer.

During the winter and tax season, overtime is offered and encouraged.  Unlike VTO, overtime was a paycheck savior.  While it was strongly encouraged, it was not mandatory, meaning you essentially have control over how much you want to make each day.  Because they only offer OT when things are incredibly busy, its pretty safe to say that every hour of OT put in is going to go by very quickly.

Training is INCREDIBLE.  When studying for the Series 7 general security license, you are paid for 20 hours out of the week to study.  If things are slow, you spend half of your day at work studying.  If things are busy, you work through the day and are expected to study at home, and that time is PAID overtime.  Huge win/win.  In my new hire class of 17 people, every single one of us passed the Series 7 on our first try, something largely unheard of in the industry.",Cons,"Career growth potential is low.  While there are a number of roles to move into that are still in the call center (retirement specialists, stock plan services, premium service, sales, etc.), they are all essentially call center jobs.  Typically, if you're an outstanding rep for a number of years, you may get promoted to a team manager, and from there I'm not sure where people go.  In my year at Fidelity I never saw a team manager leave the position, except to be a team manager with a different group (i.e. going from managing a trading/service team to a retirements team).

Also, a POTENTIAL downside is that it is a shift-based role.  Upon completing new hire training, you rank the available shifts from 1 (most desired) to 18 (least desired).  They try to put everyone in the best shift possible, but the needs of the business come first and some people are going to end up working 10 hour, 4 days shifts, Sunday through Wednesday, starting at 5 AM.  Fidelity customer service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so they need people to cover all shifts.  I got lucky and got my second pick, which was one of the many M-F 9 to 5's (my first choice was Monday through Thursday, 10 hour shifts), but there are a few people that aren't as lucky.  People that work night shifts (any shift starting at noon or later) are given a 8% pay bump while working that shift, however, so there are often people that WANT the later shifts, decreasing the chance you'd be stuck with one if you didn't want it.  Also, people can bid for a new shift once per year, so your shift is never permanent.",4

Great place to begin a career in Financial Services,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW2715248.htm,5.0,"Jun 7, 2013",Investment Solutions Representative,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Westlake, TX",Pros,"Fidelity does a great job at teaching their employees the basics of financial services. Their benefits are some of the absolute best in the industry as well. 401k plan match is 7% dollar-for-dollar with profit sharing of 10%. Health plans are especially good. The pay is also fair for a discount broker. Ultimately, Fidelity is one of the best places to work in Financial Services, because they have a long tradition of placing top priority on the customer experience. The Johnsons are good people who truly value their customers and their employees. When you are coached, it will be to whether or not the customer's needs were met, not whether you were able to sell them on an inappropriate product. Even working in sales, I always made more money off great customer surveys than I ever did due to sales results (although sales results are important as well). Lastly, the company is very conservative on a number of different topics. You are very unlikely to become involved in litigation working for Fidelity, because they stay as far away from ""the line"" as possible. Also, due to their conservative nature, FIdelity tends to be a safe place during times of layoffs unless you work in middle management.",Cons,"As great as Fidelity is, they are not without fault. Many negative things that I can say about Fidelity, I can also say for other firms as well. The Johnsons are good people. They do a great job at spreading their gospel of customer service, but sometimes the message is lost on middle-management. Middle-management tends to stress too much on day-to-day figures such as Sales, number of calls taken, and the ""customer experience indicator"" (surveys) rather than focusing on the actual interactions that reps are having with customers. 
Managers (especially in sales) also tend to not be entirely clear on what they expect from their employees. My opinion is that this is done intentionally, because they know that they can't coach you to sell something inappropriate that makes them look better on a piece of paper, but oftentimes, they won't call you out on it either if you do in fact do just that. 
Like most big firms, Fidelity can be bureaucratic in many of their operations. The main problem (which is a good problem to have) is that Fidelity is a leader in Employee retirement plans such as 401(k)'s and 403(b)'s and a leader in personal investments such as IRA's. These are technically two separate companies, but under one roof under one name. I've worked in both sides of the house, and it can be annoying to go back and forth with colleagues on the other side of the fence who have these incorrect preconceived notions about your side of the firm. It's exhausting, but it's part of working for a big company. 
Technology is one of the biggest headaches. I can honestly say that while Fidelity invests billions of dollars into technology, much of this is to improve the website. Don't get me wrong, we have a great website for customers, but they don't spend nearly enough money trying to improve quality of life for the employees. Their systems are so complicated, it was almost always easier to tell the customer how to do transaction online rather than through a rep (which is probably what they're aiming for). Also, in this modern world of e-mail, skype, facebook, etc. Many of our employees are still unable to e-mail customers which would be fine if other firms kept the same policy. Other firms have changed with the times. While, I can say that Fidelity is ""on their way."" They've also been ""on their way"" to implementing e-mail correspondence for years now. I mentioned in the Pro's that they are conservative from a legal perspective. This is where some of the cons of being conservative come into play. 
Lastly, middle management is way too politically correct. It's annoying to many employees of all backgrounds. This especially rears its ugly head in the form of reverse discrimination. Being PC is fine as long as you continue to hire good people. Usually Fidelity does a good job in hiring the right people, but occasionally I've seen them compromise just to check a box that they're a diverse firm of employees. This can especially become annoying if you're looking to get promoted.",3

I feel like the culture and environment turns my good co-workers into fearful drones looking out for only themselves. 

And now from here down are just facts:

You have to have your computer system up and running with 4-5 applications by the start of your shift. if the computer locks up, which happens at least once a day, more for others, you cannot let the customer know, keep talking, reboot, refresh etc. they are now transitioning us into a different computer system but coming up this month. I'm not optimistic. 

My Veritude hired co-workers were on the job for 6 months until transitioning into non-Veritude, or I guess ""regular Fidelity employees"" were not eligible for the mid year review raise. Also, the day they transition, their computer systems were locked up and it took all day for IT to fix. The company was not prepared. This is how I found out how many there were at my site it was about a quarter of the DC associates. Many of these people were some of the best members of my team. I didn't know what Veritude was until I read Glassdoor this evening. it is actually a Fidelity hiring department. It is a temp to hire. So Fidelity hires some employees and gives them the same job as other regular employees but they do not get the mid year review raise or quarterly bonus.

My manager purposefully plays politics and does not hide it.

The salary is very low. 

You get sick leave throughout the year but each time you call in sick it counts against you as an ""incident"". Each manager has discretion on what will be used against you. This is unfair period.

The company match is 7% on the retirement savings acct. but only after you have worked there 1 year, and you are not 100% vested until five years. 

Each site in the nation has only specific job roles available. 

Our job is to go above and beyond for the customer and work for the customer, which, if done right, means printing out statements and literature by hand and sending them in envelopes or calling out to our solutions desk to do research on complicated issues or submitting research requests which are complicated forms where we have the least bit of training on. Any work done that is not on the phone is going to be counted against your hold time, your idle time or if you are unlucky and do not take your lunch on time, your adherence time.

We get two 15 min breaks and 30 min lunch. It takes 15 min to walk down to the cafeteria to acquire food after standing in line with the slowest people in the world (management knows this) You eat in 10 min, go to the restroom and rush back to get system ready to start again. that is assuming there are no tasks to wrap up after getting off the phone and starting your lunch clock, and there always is, along with some trying to talk to you.",9

Great potential for advancement",Cons,"Fidelity - who is a recordkeeper for who knows how many companies 401k plans, has a 5 year cliff vesting schedule, and you're not even 20% vested in company contributions until 2 years.

The systems provided need a MAJOR overhaul.  There are procedural specific systems and client specific systems to use when handling calls.  These systems are not updated, so 1/2 the time you are under a constant worry if you are handling something incorrectly.  When cross trained on multiple products, you are not trained completely, so customers can ask questions you are supposed to be able to answer, but you can't because you don't know.  The answer is supposed to be searchable while you put the customer on hold to get the answer.  But holds can only be for 3 minutes, and it can take a lot longer than 3 minutes to find the answer because 1/2 the time when you search something the system comes back with no results. 

If a customer escalates, they don't go to your immediate manager, you're to call your ""solutions desk and escalate the call"" and that rep is supposed to handle the call from that point.  However the solutions desk reps are extremely lazy and will do anything and everything to push the call back on the tier 1 rep because they don't want to handle the call, thus causing the customers to become completely frustrated, yelling and screaming at us over why we are not transferring them to a supervisor, and then give us a bad customer survey.

If you need to enter a work item, they are shipped off shore to some reps in India to handle who have no idea what they are doing.  So they resolve the work item incorrectly, and we need to enter multiple work items for the same exact thing over and over.  We promise customers a 5 day work around timeframe and something so simple can take over 1 mo to resolve because the India reps just don't care.   The customers become very upset over how long it takes to resolve a simple error. 

While the company offers great potential for advancement, it is all in who you know, not what you know.  I had an interview for an internal transfer once, and while I was nervous as I didn't have a lot of interview experience at the time, my interviewer was constantly yawning and looking at his phone even before the interview started.  I don't think I was that boring, but that was extremely unprofessional and I can't believe he got the job he did because while I didn't get it, once trained I'm sure I would've been way more suited for the position. 

When you do need your manager and not a ""solutions desk rep"" they are nowhere to be found because they are always ""in a meeting"".  

This job creates a lot of extremely stressful situations, but when you become frustrated and voice your opinion, you're in the wrong and put under review or fired.  You can offer suggestions on how you think things should be and how to correct it, and management will pat you on the back for it, but then nothing is ever done to fix anything.",9

Associate Software Engineer (Leap Program),https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW23768326.htm,2.0,"Dec 9, 2018",Associate Software Engineer (Leap Program),"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Boston, MA",Pros,"Good benefits (compared to other companies with the same base salary).
401k matches up to 7% of your salary.
Total compensation (bonus, profit sharing, retirement contributions) becomes high if you stay there for a long time (5+ years).
In general, difficult to get fired unless you really mess up.
There are established Leap communities to hang out with, where ever you are placed after completing the Leap Program.",Cons,"Low base salary and total compensation for new graduates. If you don't plan on staying at Fidelity for at least 5 years, your total compensation would be better if you moved around companies or started your career at a different company.

Average software engineers. There are a few software engineers that perform above and beyond. There are several that plan to do the bare minimum and collect a paycheck. The technical interviews were not very hard, and the ability of the software engineers reflects this. This is not a great place for top (new grad) software engineers. It takes too much time (5 years) for the total compensation to be worth it.

Risk of disliking the business unit you are placed in after the Leap program. You don't get to talk directly with your after-placement manager, your Leap manager will place you after getting to know your interests and personality. I feel like 1 in 3 Leap graduates are not satisfied with their role after placement. With some bad luck, you can be placed in a business unit that offers no growth in useful technologies, no learning opportunities, and no help from senior engineers (my experience). Or with some good luck, you could be using the newest technologies with good mentors, and learning a lot. In general, they expect you to stay at least a year in your current business unit before moving, but you can tell within 6 months whether or not if the business unit and its progress are good enough for you. It is a huge gamble to enter the Leap program, knowing there is a decent chance the business unit you will be placed in will not be that worthwhile. It's up to you if you want to roll the dice. 

Emphasis on company loyalty. They tell you to focus on the ""product knowledge"",  which is useful to you only as long as you are working for Fidelity, but it's not great if you plan to leave Fidelity at any time in your life. They entice you with a total compensation that increases exponentially from 0 to 5 years. This means a below average total comp at 0 years and an above average total comp after 5 years. Many are promoted based on years of service. Even if you perform twice as well, you will not be promoted twice as quickly - it would be better for you to just switch jobs.

Slow moving technology. The company is slowly moving towards agile, cloud, and other new technologies, but change is extremely slow for financial companies. This means you might not be developing skills that are useful in your career the moment you leave Fidelity. Fidelity claims to be a technology company that specializes in finance, but improvements in technology are often hindered by business desires, such as excessive spending on contractors, and not enough spending on code refactoring and architecture improvements. Its not great for your career to be constantly one step behind everyone else.",9

They only want to hear the truth if its what they want to hear. You can be #1 in sales but if you dont further their agenda you will stall your career. Micro management is well over the top. Worst I have ever encountered. The compensation is extremely weak (My gross income here is what I used to pay in taxes at my other jobs and I am in the top 20 people out of 300  in the nation for 2 years running) Great place to get hired if you are desperate or looking for a stepping stone but will never be long term. They are short term focused but always talk about the long term. Do not let this fool you!  Middle management and some mkt mgrs truly have no clue how to manage. They are failed sales people with brown crust on their noses that micro manage and have little to zero outside experience ( this is their only real job since college).  The work and dealing with clients is ok as the Fido client is a cheapskate and know-it-all. It takes time to build trust, realtionships and for the client to self discover they need your/Fido help. Management wants you to slam them into products today. A ""what have you done for me today"" mentality. If your response is ""built a deeper relationship 
based on trust and confidence"" the branch mgr will look at you like a cyborg and keep repeating  ""that does not calculate"" until his brain starts to smoke. Corp vision is a lie. They say they want to retain top talent and build long term relationships. Look at their actions. It is a lie. 5 top Senior Accountt execs left in the last 12 months. Everyone of them were threatened on the way out by their mgr rather than spoken to for retention measures. If this were a public company I would buy a put 3 years in the future so i could put it to someone I hated and make a killing from their lose. It is a truly broken system and the mend is at minmum 5 years away. Possibly a decade. Lastly, once you do sell something you have to track it and a third of the time sent up exception as they are not crediting it to you but atbthe same time will be delivering you an oral warning of termination for low production which they will not rescind once its credited and also become part of your HR file.

When I've had visitors in on a Friday in the summer, and only 6 of 30 team members are in, they ask ""where is everyone"" and I have to explain that this is normal. Largely ""Working From Home"" is used more than it should.

As far as ambitions go, Abby and Ned own the company. What they want goes. As such, you can expect fiats from on high and many people and divisions shuffling along, getting by. This is not a terrible thing, but you'll not find floors of teams rushing to ""get it done"" and invent the ""next great thing"" despite the corporate newsletters the champion such internal trends. Rather you'll find bureaucracy, process, and more process taking weeks to do something as simple as write a single line query. One fiat was all applications moving to Linux servers from Window servers. Why? Ned had met Bill Gates at a conference and decided he didn't like him, so we needed to get rid of Windows.

Nice facilities.",Cons,"Big Warning: Fidelity is divesting in Boston and New England. They are moving all the jobs they can to Raleigh (NC), Westlake (TX), Ireland, China and India. Every year more Boston teams get sacked and given the ""chance"" to move 2000mi or more, though usually only 10% take the offer. Be careful if you're not deeply entrenched in the front office, your days are likely numbered.

Everyone keeps to themselves. Passing people in the hall, they stare at the floor. In the elevators you could hear a pin drop. Folks are not outgoing and I've seen many teams that sit 10 yards apart and don't know each other at all. This helps breed the internal silos and technical fiefdoms. If you behave gregariously, people will be surprised.

Fidelity IT loves to talk about Agile, but we actually use FAM, the Fidelity Agile Methodology. During your interview, ask deep questions about how so called ""Agile"" teams work and you'll be in for a laugh. FAM is a broken application of Agile and little better than classic waterfall. If you've really learned Agile elsewhere, people are going to laugh at you your first few weeks here.

Training is good, they will hold your hand and spoon feed you through anything to get you certified.",Cons,"Welcome to Corporate America. Promotions can be a nightmare with hurry up and wait mentality. sometimes there will be 6 months between job opportunities. In Denver there is a very limited amount of opportunities, managers will tell you to move to the east coast if you don't like the jobs available. Trade support will witch hunt you if you get a trade error, even if its for 1 cent. Trade errors are used to punish employees and lowers your chances of getting promoted. Managers will use fear tactics to push the bottom line which has more to do with customer surveys than anything else if you are in service. I wish I could write some of the profanity the customers will say to you over the phone, truly horrific dealing with the general public. Training in large classes of 20+ young professionals feels a lot like high school and its not ideal for education. Classes tend to get ""clicky"" and like managers, the facilitators always have their favorites. Unless you are a great ""suck up"" don't expect to get promoted based on your merits here.",5

The training is good and you get a lot of support.  Management encourages feedback and evaluation of everything.  Fidelity promotes from within.  If you are a young person just starting out in a new career, it is an excellent place to get started and move up.  They like to train people into their own culture and reward those who comply.  When you apply for other opportunities, they give you feedback if you are not chosen.   The benefits package is good.  Even though this is a call center environment and it can be busy, it is a pleasant place to be and I have never felt overly micro-managed.  The callers are usually nice and pleasant and management encourages helping the customer no matter how long it takes.  Customers routinely tell us how they appreciate the service they get.  There are often potlucks and employee appreciation events and fun things going on.",Cons,"The facility is in a somewhat remote location and is a long drive.  If you are an experienced person, unfortunately opportunities to move up seem to be more limited.  The company tends to prefer training inexperienced people instead of promoting people who have experience from elsewhere.  The recruiters will promise you career opportunities, but there are some interesting politics involved in getting the other opportunities that they do not tell you about.  There are a lot of very young managers who started out with the company, but who do not have a lot of management experience.  While everyone is very nice and friendly, sometimes they seem to be intimidated by older, more experienced staff and look for ways to deny opportunities instead of trying to fit people in where they are most qualified.",3

If your manager likes you and you have a decent relationship then you get raises & bonuses.   I have never seen so many mgmt people afraid of conflict, afraid to tell employees they were not performing, etc.  The culture is one of fear to tell the truth, when people are asked they do not tell the truth because they fear retaliation.   I personally sat in a senior mgmt meeting and heard a Sr. VP, tell another manager to tell her minions to stop sending feedback to Sr. Mgmt, they may ask for it but dont really want to hear it.  When they downsized a few yrs back they laidoff some of the best most knowledgeable talent, i suspect bcuz they made the most money, but many left were clueless which meant that those remaining had to do twice as much and cover the clueless.

Not everyone makes it in the first 8-10 weeks of training and they either quit because they find out that the job is not for them or they fail the Series 7/63 tests. It's a great feeling of accomplishment after you get through the initial training program and pass the financial licensing exams and you feel like you belong to a strong reputable company. From there you can move on to other departments like sales, stock and options trading, 401K investment guidance, pensions, operations, management, training and education, support desk help, compliance, etc depending on your interests. Everyone that I worked with in management was very supportive of my goals in wanting to move up in the company or try different areas of the business. As long as you have a plan and show interest in another position, they help you secure the position by working with the managers of the group or department that you are interested in. The 401K/health/reimbursement benefits are the added incentives to staying with Fidelity long term and the 401K matching/profit sharing is the best in the financial services industry, maybe even most of corporate America.",Cons,"The downsides to Fidelity is that you are working in a call center and sometimes day to day activity can become boring, mundane and very repetitive. Some managers are known to micromanage when you can take breaks including how often and they monitor operational metrics very closely (number of calls taken, average handle time and how much time after every phone call). They are very persistent about coaching on what is the best language to approach each customer, sometimes to a point of emphasizing perfection. If you are there for 5 yrs or more, base salary becomes stagnant and it becomes more challenging to apply for positions and roles that offer more compensation potential because the people in those positions have been there for 10 years or more.",3

- There is a strong focus on diversity and Employee Resource Groups
- Colleagues are friendly, managers treat their employees with respect and kindness.
- The company has a new talent pipeline in its internship program, and a great bootcamp program for new hires. The company's best employees come from this program.
- Embrace of Agile Scrum and Kanban
- Upper technical management is staffed by good, eager, and talented people that want to change things for the better.
- If you are a go-getter, there is much opportunity to make it up the ranks.",Cons,"- Low technical talent: The company uses about 45% contractor workforce (even in the US). A lot of technical knowledge leaves company every year. Huge turnover rate in the technical ranks. Many of these contractors have low skills that do not match their resume.
- While it is good the company gives people low on experience a chance (sometimes the first chance of their career), the flip-side is that there are a lot of people that don't know what they are doing. Huge brain drain in the early 2000s at this company that the company never fully recovered from (many firms in the same industry experienced the same).
- Very incompetent teammates. ""Very"" with a capital ""V"". You have to constantly get on people just to get the work done that they promised to do. Sometimes takes weeks to find an administrator to grant access or turn a setting on. Sometimes requirements are completely misunderstood.
- Agile scrum meetings go on for too long. Oftentimes, over half a day is spent in meetings. The prevailing attitude at the company is that strictly adhering to Agile ceremonies will magically get the Sprint work done.
- Non-technical people are scrum masters (SMs): Although it is technically not a requirement, it is a bit of an obstacle to have non-technical people as SMs for Software Engineering work. Despite my 17 years of experience as a Software Engineer, I often found myself being contradicted by SMs with less than 5 years experience, and zero years as a Software Developer. Sadly, most (but not all) SMs have very little interest in understanding the the work they were SMing for.

Challenging culture,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW618521.htm,3.0,"Aug 20, 2010",Director of Operations,Former Employee,"Boston, MA",Pros,"Fidelity employs some of the brightest, most innovative and dedicated people in the industry.  The culture is high energy and fast-paced so you'll never be bored.  Most people are willing to step up and share their expertise while fighting fires (if you know which group/s and which person, within that group, to ask).  Most people in support/ops are required to work an excessive number of hours each week (usually 60+) but you can learn more at Fidelity in 1 year than you would learn at another investment firm.",Cons,"The culture can be highly stressful at the best of times but numerous Reductions in Force (RIF's) over the past several years have impacted morale and compounded the stress level.  Entire groups have been RIFed, regardless of the criticality of their function or their individual performance ratings.  I know of numerous high-quality, highly respected people who have been let go as part of the on-going re-org, so performance, dedication and a good review rating won't save you from a RIF if your group is a focus.  Reviews for bonuses and raises seem to be based less on performance than on the corporate review paradigm, which dictates that a manager must assign a specific number of satisfactory, sub-standard and outstanding ratings (example - a manager with 10 direct reports can be given the directive that of their 10 direct reports, they must have 1 employee rated sub-standard and only 1 rated outstanding.  The other 8 must be rated Proficient/Satisfactory, regardless of performance.  Due to Fido having such a high number of exceptionally bright and dedicated people, who step up when they see a problem, it is fairly common to find groups where the majority (if not all) of the team members deserve an Outstanding rating.  With the existing paradigm, only 1 can receive that rating and receive a fair bonus/raise.  Eight of the others will receive a Proficient/Satisfactory rating and receive very small bonus/raises.  And one of those 10 people will receive a rating of  N ('Needs Improvement'), which prohibits a raise/bonus and tags them as a probability for the next RIF - and you can't internally transfer if you received a rating of N).  Promotions are also tied to review ratings.  Before I left, the policy was that an employee had to receive 2 consecutive reviews of above Satisfactory/Proficient to qualify for a possible promotion.  That did not ensure they would receive the promotion, it just meant that they qualified for a possible promotion, if one was available.

You can't wear jeans or baseball caps or certain items of clothing.You can feel the money. If you are interested in understanding how big brokerage  companies like Fidelity manage to keep track of it all you would like it.  You usually feel engaged. There is a lot of software development so it's not always legacy applications if you work in technology.  Generally you will be thanked for your work and told you are doing well (unless you suck at your job) . There are lots of kitchens scattered around and there is lots of free food there often leftover from being served in meetings.

very boring, but very thorough.

Ok job for a fresh college graduate, but other than that I would advise one to stay away.

Good food on campus. They hire good cooks to feed us while work. Decent pricing too",Cons,"Once you get licensed and ""get on the floor"" that is when the trouble begins.

The job is extremely boring. Dealing with people calling every second of the day from about 9-4pm is horrible. Most of the time you are resetting passwords, not actually doing anything finance related. And when you do get the chance to do finance related things, all you do is enter trade tickets and hit send.

In training, they sold to us that we are ""financial professionals,"" however, I would beg to differ. The only difference between ""service associates"" and a regular CSR rep is that at Fidelity, you are licensed.

The job sucks. It sucks your soul. It is not a fun environment. IF you enjoy  answering calls all day for $16-20 dollars a hour, have at it.

**Also, it should be noted that promotion to the sales side is extremely hard. There are 200 apps a year for 25-50 sales jobs. You have to kiss major butt and kill your metrics to get ahead. It is just too many people applying for those jobs. Managers will say that there are so many positions you can work in, but in reality they are all the same job, with a x<5000 in pay differential in the service side.

As a phone representative the number one benefit is the colleagues that share the role and the customers we get to hear from. Really enjoy the interactions with the diverse active and retiree populations!,Cons,"Huge downside at the Durham NC location. Many of the floor managers are unprofessional and constantly an impediment to helping the customer and helping employees develop. This is the first and only organization that I have worked for that will actually discourage you from applying to an open position within the firm. Has happened on a few occasions now and so appears to be the norm where to apply you need to go through current manager and they never follow up to discuss or confirm if an intent letter was forwarded.

Most of the managers I have interacted with were never able to answer serious inquiries on customer accounts and push back greatly when a customer requests to speak to them. Very sad to think I could be treated that way when calling in as a customer.

These same individuals are commonly loud in the call center environment where it is common to not be able to hear the customer on the line. Just recently I had to put a customer on hold while doing a death notification because I did not feel it appropriate for the caller to hear the loud laughing from a manager and team leads. This is a very common occurrence at this location. Finally, quite a few give me the impression that they do not do much at all during the day besides going to the gym (1+ hr), out to lunch (1 hr), listening to calls, and meetings. Back to the serious customer issues, have only had one manager that ever seemed to care about the issue and helped to get it resolved.

At this time it does appear this situation as a whole is why I will leave Fidelity and transfer all funds immediately thereafter.",6

About 20-30% less than comparable positions at other companies.

Fidelity used to be a great place to work,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW106387.htm,3.0,"Oct 25, 2008",Systems Analyst,Current Employee,"Boston, MA",Pros,"As an employee, you get cheap access to Fidelity's products, such as brokerage account, mutual funds, etc.  If the assets are under Fidelity management, you get it cheaper.  For example, a person with an HSA account at another firm pays annual fees, because Fidelity runs your HSA, you don't get hit with fees.  Also, Fidelity spends a ton of money on technology, so you will have nice desktop hardware and software.  The facilities are generally nice and well stocked with coffee and tea.",Cons,"As an employee, you are forced to use Fidelity's products, e.g., you can't have a brokerage account anywhere else or a financial advisor if he or she places trades and if you buy other company's mutual funds, you have to report it.  
The culture is almost like a fuedal manor with a benevolent lord.  The employees are expected to show tremendous loyalty to the firm.  To hear some talk, there is no other place they could ever work.  This used to be okay when Mr. J was more involved and the managment reciprocated some of that loyalty.  But it just isn't the case anymore.  At any given time you could have your job moved to a cheaper state, India, or just plain eliminated.  Sr. managment communication is full of sports metaphores and lofty vision statements, but surprisingly silent about long term plans related to employees such as site closures or changes to business lines.  Increasingly we have stealth layoffs.  The only way you hear about whole areas being eliminated is if you happen to have a friend that works there.  People just disappear off the company directory.  At least in 2001 and 2002 they bothered to tell everyone what was going on.  Lastly, it has become almost impossible to move internally.  They recently added another HR layer between a candidate and a hiring manager, so now if you want to post you have to go through your manager, an ""internal staffing rep"" who will decide whether you should even be thinking about moving, a staffing rep who will decide if you should be considered for the position, and then finally the hiring manager.  Most of the time the hiring manager never even sees your resume.  If you do happen to get that far, the hiring manager is prohibited from making an offer until he or she has gotten a reference from your current manager.  If you do apply for a position and you aren't being considered, no one ever bothers to tell you.",3

Good and bad,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW283583.htm,3.0,"Sep 12, 2009",Service Representative - Trading,Current Employee,"Jacksonville, FL",Pros,"Pay is decent for young college grads; also good benefits.  401k - they potentially match up to 17% after some tenure,  Most of the people you work with are decent people.  Almost everyone realizes it's not the most exciting or fulfilling job; it's like everyone's in the same boat.  We can always connect with each other based upon bad calls we've had or some worthless reprimand from management.",Cons,"Since the first day I've been there, it's felt like we're in elementary school or some nice form of a concentration camp.  You are almost told verbatim what to say.  The call model is a decent model, but management needs to understand that not every call is worth the whole effort.  Not client needs our guidance services, not everyone is an active trader.  

Also, there is a large amount of knowledge that is needed.  Not that it is necessarily a bad thing, but the environment is horrible.  There are several different computer programs we use for various things.  One for trading, one for problem resolution, one for money movement.  A small mistake or overlook is looked heavily down upon.  If, God forbid, you make a ""trade error,"" you are reprimanded even if it had little to no impact on the company (I've also had trade errors that made the company money).  

Even if the mistake was question that 99 out of 100 people don't know about how our internal systems work, there is supposedly always an answer in OLR.  It stands for OnLine Reference.  It's basically the Fidelity bible for trading and service.  Problem is that OLR must have been written by either a mad robot or Ned Johnson himself.  It's not written well at all and even sometimes contain mistakes that we still ""should have known.""  

We are given several metrics that we must meet that grade us on various call aspects; these include: average call time, scheduling efficiency (how closely you fit into a minute by minute schedule daily), and % of time either in available to talk to on a call.  

As reps we are expected to ""put the customer first"" at all times.  They should really rephrase that to ""put the customer first only on that phone call.""  After the call ends, so does any contact that we have with that person.  Why is this a problem?  About 25% of the calls you take are problems that may take awhile to fix.  There is no researching or following up on problems after the call.  Managers criticize calling back customers.  

Also, about 92% of managers are really horrible people.",3
Your Experience at Fidelity Varies Depending on Your Manager; CONSTANT reorganization,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW357715.htm,4.0,"Jan 6, 2010",Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,"Boston, MA",Pros,"Benefits, including tuition reimbursement, 401K match, and annual bonuses are excellent; for the most part, it is a stable place to work, earn a good salary and interact with nice, smart people.",Cons,"If you decide to work at Fidelity, make sure you like change -- there lots of it here (or Kaisan as the chairman calls it) especially within leadership.  Often times a new manager is brought in with a new ""strategic vision"" and you basically discard all the work you've done over the past 9 months and start over...this can happen again and again and can be frustrating...

I worked in several different business units during my 9 years with the company, and because the company is simply so huge, I found that if you have a good manager, you'll have a pleasant experience and receive appropriate performance and financial reviews and feedback, etc. BUT if your manager is one of many who are not good at being managers or for whatever reason don't ""click"" with you, it can become a miserable experience. HR tends to side with management, and it's extremely difficult to remove an incompetent or toxic boss from Fidelity.  Normally, you can weed these individuals out during your interview, but as I mentioned previously, Fidelity re-orgs so frequently, 90% of individuals hired end up working for different managers and doing different work than they signed on to do.  

You need to be prepared to roll with the punches and have a very flexible nature if you choose to work at Fidelity.

As far as promotional opportunity, there's no set rule such as after 2 years, you get promoted - i've seen individuals be promoted after 6 months or never promoted after many, many years.  Because your individual manager basically exclusively drives the promotion process, making sure he/she likes you is key.  When it comes to advancement, doing good work is often secondary to building a good relationship with your direct manager.",2

Layoffs happen monthly(for the last 2 years!). Most everyone is trying to get you fired, especially at bonus time. Bonuses, raises, and long term comp are often cut even when the company has record profits. Senior managers live in fear of the Family and will throw you under the bus if it helps them. We have a saying: the bullet that will kill you has already been fired, it is just a matter of when it will catch up to you. And I say this as someone who has been successful here and still am. Politics exist everywhere, but this place is a viper pit. Many, many successful execs have been hired and fired in under a year simply because the old guard decided to poison the well on them. Unless you started here twenty years ago or are part of The Family, you are dead. No manager will ever extend his personal political capital to save you.",5

Very nice 401k match and profit sharing. Bonus's are great if you're in the top 5-10% of the company.  I believe Senior management is very good. The Johnson family has been good.

Kathy Murphy was a great addition to the company.",Cons,"I find there is a complete lack of respect for the regular employee.  Very low pay and bonus's for most employees. As you move up with in the company a culture of superiority is fostered and encouraged. You have royalty and the peasants. 

Most middle management  has been brainwashed and this is their only professional experience, thus they think and act a like.....very scary if you've worked anywhere else.  If you ever express an opinion or disagree with those folks.....you're permanently branded.  You can do that with the highest levels of management and it would be respected (they are far away and only get to visit a few times a year). 

Employee turnover is unbelievably high (this is good for creating opportunity), however, it's a reflection of how employees are treated.  Management encourages people to be given warnings  to increase job performance vs. rewarding them.   

e.g. You have 10 business goals. You could be doubling your results with nine of them, however, you're just below goal with one that's not up on the list of importantance.  Instead of averaging out your overall performance, they will focus on that one thing again and again. The person who just barely made the goal with all 10 is far better than you are.

The company will waste money and spend lavishly all for show but a great majority of employees don't benefit from this.",3

Bonuses are based off of customer surveys of your entire team (not individually) you get % based off phone metrics. 
Metrics are not designed for you to keep the customers interest in mind (ex: if you have to call back to a customer - break between calls to finish a project or do some research for a customers issue - your metrics take a hit). 
You get 3 calls/month monitored and graded on if you said what your manager wanted you to say (can be a little childish at times and not a good measurement  3/500 calls graded) 
Days you will take 60-70 phone calls a day for 8-10hrs (cant focus on customers individually - turn and burn).  
Branch employees are viewed as more valuable to the company and are told to ""dump"" issues to phone centers (they do not know how to complete any processes for clients).

Many people spend their entire working careers at Fidelity.",Cons,"There aren't a lot of cons other than some of the people--a lot of middle management can be extremely obnoxious with inflated heads & egos, and they are also the ones who somewhat control your career, besides yourself, of course.  
Fidelity is way too conservative too, which can also be a 'pro.'  And their compliance policies are some of the strictest you'll see anywhere.  
They need to show their employees how much they value them with better pay--a lot of the positions deserve to be paid a bit more for the hard work that is expected, but again, it's hard to complain about that b/c of everything else that is positive about the company.

I felt proud of the products we sold and knew that people really put their energy into doing the best possible thing for the customers.  From the chairman down this was how the company operated.  There was never any question about that.,Cons,"There is an unusual culture of politeness, but not in a way that is productive.  People nodding and smiling did not mean your idea had acceptance - outside of the meeting people nodding and smiling could work vigorously to defeat the idea.  The lack of openness and vigorous debate was unusual.  

The compensation at the executive level has a highly variable component based on the company's performance.  People who had been successful getting internal ""shares"" tended to become more and more protective of their position and their turf.  They had to continue to look good to get more and more shares and would actively undermine anyone with ideas different from theirs.  I think this compensation model stifled innovation.  People who rocked the boat didn't last very long; many of the people I admired in the executive ranks were eliminated during ""reductions of force"".  There are antibodies to thought diversity that are really difficult to overcome.

I'd thought I'd be a lifer, but lost my job after 15 years during the 2008 recession.

So many managers with so little formal education in management or prior experience. Stunned at lower level management incompetence, although they are powerless to promote change as upper management directives and metrics are etched in stone and beyond reproach as the higher level VP's strive to hit their own metrics at the expense of their departments well being.

-Management was reasonable and let me leave the phone position to an internal operations position before I had been working there one year.",Cons,"-First of all, it is a call center job.  The title makes it sound fancier and in the interview they might make you think you are going to be doing a lot more things related to investments than you actually will.  Probably 80% of calls are password resets and simple financial transactions.
-Benefits are good as a percentage, but my base salary was so much lower than what I made after I left that 7%  401k match AND 10% profit sharing was less than 4.5% 401k match at my current company.  There are a lot of benefits that most people don't use that they use to justify how great the benefits are.  Like adoption assistance, tuition reimbursement, college loan assistance.  Just do the math with what you will use and how much you'll get with your salary.  Remember that your base salary grows exponentially with raises and your benefits grow based on that.  Lower base salary now = even lower base salary in 10 years.
-They say they pay for the CFA; they don't.  They specifically told me in the interview that they pay for CFA prep classes.  It also says that in the tuition reimbursement documentation.  There is one stipulation though.  It only qualifies if you take the class from an accredited university.  I don't know of any official universities that offer specific CFA review classes (you take the review classes to prepare for the test, not to get college credit).  I had a friend who took Kaplan review classes and then fought with them for months for the reimbursement and ended up just giving up.  I took and passed two CFA tests while there without a penny going towards the classes.  I don't know if they are intentially tricking people or if nobody knows enought about the CFA to know that the stipulation the put on it makes it null.
-The job itself is miserable.  So many metrics that you have to hit, fielding literally thousands or random questions and complaints.  Constant coaching (telling you what you do wrong).  One time I got ""feedback"" for saying ""no problem"" because ""problem"" is a negative word.  There were days when I would get up, take a shower, get dressed and then call in and go back to sleep because I just couldn't bring myself to go back there again. Some people were ok with it though.

2. Numerous different business units and sub-groups, many different career paths, multiple locations. Working remote up to 100% a possibility for many positions (off-phone), depending on business group.
3. Mostly good opportunities to improve your skills and knowledge.
4. Massive population to network.",Cons,"1. Bureaucracy still reigns. Common Sense doesn't always prevail. The simplest things are made complicated... Every time a new senior leader arrives, there is a re-org or re-alignment... They say associates have a voice and they do survey associates, but if you speak up otherwise, do so at your own risk...
2. The company is making great strides towards improving career mobility but many legacy barriers remain in place, including attitudes of hiring managers and their superiors.
3. Very conservative company when it comes to risk...decisions are made by ""committee"" after exhaustive discussions, even over the most smallest and trivial things. Many times your work gets trapped by becoming all about the process and not the outcome.
4. Top Heavy. Appears to be a large population in the lower pay grades, but very few in the middle (managers, sr. managers), and an enormous Director, VP, and above segment. The top segment is all about taking care of each other when not competing or fighting one another.
5. Unless you sexually harass someone or get caught stealing something, no one gets fired unless it's an overall reduction in force. Lazy or inept associates are coddled or passed along.",2

Not a lot of pressure to get things done
Nice office/campus
Free rent for 5 months
Get paid to do pretty much nothing all day

This was my first job out of college as a software developer. They have a training program where they send you to North Carolina for five months to learn about various technologies and to work on a ""real life"" project.

About halfway through the program you get notified of the actual team that you'll be on when you return to your job site. You have some input with this, but the decision is ultimately made by management.

The program itself isn't too bad. I learned about a lot of technologies that I hadn't heard of and it gave me a little bit of real world experience.",Cons,"Work non-existent/not challenging
Office is located in the middle of nowhere (Texas)
Old fashioned attitudes
Not a lot of young people unless you work in the call center
Old technology
Too much bureaucracy

The downside to the training program is that the team that you get placed on is very hit or miss and very much or if your control. Some people were placed on awesome teams working with cool products and technologies while others were stuck working on software that was 20 years old. 

Also during the training there are a lot of B.S. corporate events/talks, which were super cheesy and unnecessary. Some of the topics during training were a waste of time too, like learning how to write an e-mail (yes, I'm serious).

The team I was placed on seemed to have no plan in place for me when I got there despite the fact that a manager has to request an associate from the aforementioned training program so it's not like I was placed on their team by surprise or without their knowledge.

The whole time I was there I wrote probably a total of 20 lines of code because the product was in maintenance and there was very little new development. There wasn't really any work for me to do, so I essentially got paid to read reddit all day.

There are tons of meetings to attend and most of them are just people from various teams/business units arguing over minute details about random aspects of a project. The amount of red tape that you have to go through to get things done is pretty high.",4

The only review that matters,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW25208943.htm,1.0,"Mar 17, 2019",Customer Relationship Advocate,Former Employee,,Pros,"Beautiful campus
You don't take work home
Big name to add to your resume",Cons,"Honestly there are a lot of cons. I'll start with pay. The pay is definitely below market value. It's a hot economy and Fidelity openly admits that it pays less because the compensation is weighed more towards benefits. The problem is the benefits here aren't all that great. For example it takes 5 years to get vested in your 401k and a year before you are eligible for any match from the company. This may have been more impressive a few years ago, but many companies will vest you day 1 or within the first year of employment along with a match. 

Career advancement is slim to none for new associates. They have a career center on campus to help provide options for career growth, but the positions just aren't very attractive (phone work and processing work for various business units) and the level of effort to get those jobs is the same as just applying and interviewing for an outside role. There are too many hoops to jump through to move up within the company and honestly most people are in entry level roles for years before they move onto something else. Do you want to guarantee that you make entry level pay for years in this economy?

The biggest con is definitely the work itself. I worked in a phone role in PI and it was without a doubt the worst professional experience I've ever had. Imagine having to describe something you hated day in and day out with a character limit. This is my dilemma. 

The job is ultimately a burnout job. You take 50-60 calls a day while processing requests in customer's accounts. There are numerous challenges whether it is explaining complex trading strategies to people, helping an 80 year old log into Fidelity.com and locating documents, telling a customer you cannot recommend specific stocks to them, calming down an angry customer cussing at you. It goes on and on. This isn't to mention challenges related to technology or hold times within departments. You're getting hit from all sides and will disappoint a lot of customers with Fidelity's policies (and lack of exceptions). The worst part of this job is knowing you did it and didn't build any meaningful experience to add to your resume. You never get to think for yourself or lead any sort of project since you're always on the assembly line.

Emerging Leader Program,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW29278857.htm,2.0,"Sep 17, 2019","Associate, Emerging Leader Program","Current Employee, more than 1 year","Boston, MA",Pros,"***This review and ratings are oriented towards the Emerging Leader Program, not Fidelity as a firm.***

Meeting Executives: ELP presents several opportunities to meet executives across the firm, and we even have a team Q&A session with the CEO. At the end of the program, we report out a capstone project to all the executives, which is great visibility. 

Enterprise-Wide View: Since you are rotating in all different areas of Fidelity, you get a great view of how the firm functions as a whole. With the firm's initiative to work better as a collective unit (as opposed to silos), this is an opportunity that allows you to bring a lot of insights to different groups. 

Work-life Balance: I have never had an instance where I've had to work more than 40 hours in a week, and management is very flexible if you need to take time off during the day as long as you're getting your work done. Planning vacation is never an issue, management would never say you can't take a vacation or anything like that.",Cons,"Compensation: Compensation is extremely low for the caliber of people they expect to hire for ELP. They told us they did 'comp' research and that we're in line with other liberal arts grads in the business sector, but for the amount of knowledge and commitment they are asking (jumping around different BUs and delivering business value straight away, commuting over 110 miles a day some months) we are grossly underpaid. Several of us have done research and know we can get at least 25% more at any other comparable role. They tell us that our amazing benefits make up for it, but I don't see many of us, right out of college, using home insurance benefits or ""College Success Planning."" Those of us holding out are hopeful that our final placement salaries will be a significant increase. 

Management: Management is not as up-to-par as would be expected for a program that recruits from elite liberal arts colleges. One of the managers has an online degree from a for-profit university and it shows- no critical thought, inability to understand and digest feedback without getting defensive, and has worked her way up using relationship skills without actually being qualified for her position in regard to merit. Her manager, an SVP, is too busy with her other initiatives and only seems to present herself at the ""fun"" opportunities - team-building sessions, orientation, etc. We as a cohort have no insight into what she is doing for the program or if feedback is being relayed up to her at all. Overall, the management team may be well intentioned but lacks clear direction and minimizes transparency in order to hide the fact that they don't really know what they're doing either. 

Rotations: While ELP may present itself as a cool opportunity to explore different functions, expect to be disappointed when finding out where you got placed. Rotations are based on ""business need,"" meaning that while you may express interest in a particular field, you may end up in a completely different field. Management will try to make it seem okay by pointing out the ""positives,"" but it doesn't address the fact that you may potentially waste four months doing something you have no interest in doing and you could've spent doing something that would actually bring some clarity to your career options. 

Final Placement: Placement after the program is supposed to be based the rotation that you matched the most with and enjoyed doing. However, some people get rotations that have no intention of hiring someone from ELP, and get stuck with getting placed in one of their rotations they didn't enjoy or have to scramble to network to see if there are any opportunities available outside of their rotations. Once that process is done and you have your options (assuming you have more than one option), you don't even know salary information until AFTER informally accepting the full-time position- we're supposed to not worry about salary and instead choose the placement option that best ""aligns"" with our career wants. After this informal acceptance, we then get the ""official"" offer letter and sign that. I've never heard of an instance where you don't know salary information before accepting a role, but like in many other cases where things in the program don't make sense, there is always a ""reason"" for the way things are. 

""Trust the Process"" : If I had a penny for every time I heard ""Trust the Process""...this is the term used by management as a palliative for the program's serious structural issues. Hate the rotation you're in? There's a reason why you got it, you just have to trust the process. Is your rotation not even close to what your career goals are? There's a reason for that, trust the process. If you ever hear this phrase, beware!",4

Its simply not about how well you do your job - many people have realized that doing well and being rewarded is as much about making the other person look bad to make you look better.    If getting ahead for you means throwing your co-worker under the bus, then this is the place for you.   Its such a shame, because the company could be so great, but the culture of fear is simply gripping the place so that people are terrified, yet in many cases they are paid so well that they are equally afraid to leave.   Someone who left once told me that working there was like being in an abusive relationship - and you don't realize it until after you have left.   So many examples of people who on one day are viewed as superstars, and the next day they are suddenly viewed at the bottom of the heap - in many cases this happens when their manager leaves, and the former manager loved them, but the new manager doesn't value them and wants them gone.  So, you come to realize that the ball can drop on you at any moment.   I remember one executive saying, verbatim, ""we all have a bullet with our name on it, and its only a matter of time until it hits you.""

You are taking phone calls and there is a call model to follow but it merely guides the flow of the conversation, it does not generally have things you must say word for word, therefore you don't sound and feel like a robot despite the extreme repetitiveness of taking phone calls.  

Looks great on a resume, and is a foot in the door for the finance industry.",Cons,"Disorganized between departments, as well as possible and probable deliberate deception of employees, dangling the carrot so to speak.  And as most places have, occasional incompetent managers.

This specific role was all inbound phone calls which were randomly graded by customers and managers.  Managers who graded your calls were inconsistent with each other, one would give you high marks for a chosen course of action while another would mark low and suggest an alternate route.  Or there was the occasional manager who would mark lower than average scores across the board compared to other managers.

Myself and a few others were selected to get our series 6 & 7's and moved to a different division of WPI (workplace investing, you deal with 401k's and similar accounts) where we made a new team with a new manager.  One week later we are all told there was an error in planning, and nobody in our newly found division would be getting licensed.  However, the division we left would all be getting licensed.  When I asked, I was told I could not be moved back to my old team, or join the training and stay in my new role.  A few months later our new division was told we would all be getting licensed as well, only to be told a week later, again, that we would not be getting licensed.  

You are always expected to probe for outside assets that could be brought to Fidelity.  If there are assets which can be brought it, after finding them you must transfer the call to a specialist who makes money based on how much he brings in.  The numbers you bring in to this department, as well as what actually comes into the company from these leads are tracked by Fidelity, and unable to be viewed by yourself.  Management says it doesn't matter what you bring in because it's not your job, but again, these numbers are tracked and managers have access to them, keeping them high will most likely open new doors despite what is said.

Corporate culture seems that Fidelity wants cheerleaders more than employees.  Make the customers believe we're great and you will be too if you give us your money.  I came here to help people, and I was naive.  It is all about getting more money in the door.  But if you can make a lot of money working for Fidelity, and have relatively good job security.",2

Overall, poor support of all the main themes they advocate: work life balance, integrity, culture.   The process that managers are required to maintain a working relationship with their employees doesn't apply with upper management.  They put out fires and congregate only when corp executives are paying attention.  Huge inconsistencies in OT needs vs. life balance, actual job role vs. what you're responsible for, company processes vs. actual process.  

* A lot of managers confused, uncomfortable, and/or constantly feel their job is at risk.   

* The allowed leniency within each business unit makes for huge discrepancies. 

* A lot of complaints from employees and management that there's a clear disregard to promote people who are actually qualified.

* Compensation was below average locally and nationally across multiple roles.  Team that up with OT + added responsibilities + inconsistent processes + mixed communications and you get high stress for less than average.

** It has a lot of the typical political messes a job like this brings.  Advancement is possible, but, similar to most companies, you must be liked by the right people.  Compensation is comparable if you're one of the top 15% who are selected for one of their prestigious sales roles.

** A lot of peers or co-workers outside of the phone sites are relatively more satisfied with the company overall.  So, aim for a corporate role or one outside the phone sites is my recommendation if considering this company.",2

Occasional travel to conferences once you have experience.  Abundance of opportunity to learn if you apply yourself.  A good job out of college for a few years and then it's best to move on.",Cons,"This particular position is a dead end, but management may lead you to believe your responsibility will improve or that you are doing work that is important.  The work is simply making charts and analyzing numbers in Excel, which others will use to make decisions and this gets boring quickly.  The people you will work for can be high strung and passive aggressive, so they will ask you to do something and then hover over you until it is done, or they will be short with you and then friendly later on to make up for their initial rudeness.  Few of them have the time to teach you, so be prepared to learn on your own.  The corporate culture is poor because the main hires are highly intellectual people from top universities who typically have limited social ability.  People in my department went through the day with little social interaction and when they did interact it was forced and awkward.  The managers are better socially, but they don't know how to lead people because their prior roles were individualistic assignments.  Those assignments didn't allow for the opportunity to hone people management or leadership skills.  Instead of rolling up their sleeves and making the occasional tough call, managers sometimes pay people lip service and kick the can down the road.  Management's personnel decisions come slowly or not at all for fear that those decisions won't work out and it will reflect poorly on them.  Upper level executives are slow to make any drastic or necessary operating and strategic decisions, which are required in this rapidly changing industry.  The company is strategically behind the 8 ball as a result.  People usually stick around for so long because it pays well and people sort of muddle through New England life at this company.",2

And the system tolerates this because there is no system to objectively identify top-performers. The bi-annual performance appraisal is a farce. 

And something very striking about the place is that we don't have any benchmarks of how long a certain job or project should take and we willingly spend $1000 on a project that would get done with better quality and shorter timeframe for $200 elsewhere.

Dress code",Cons,"I originally found this job posting when searching for Hospitality related jobs. Hospitality professionals, BEWARE. They are going to tell you that you don't need a finance background and that they can teach you everything you need to know. This is not all together true. They are going to train you the absolute minimum that they can, and then they throw you onto the phones. 

This is not a customer service position. It's sales. Most of the calls are awful, and people pretty much yell at you all day for things that are completely out of your control.  Need help? Call your help desk that's most likely to belittle you and make you feel like an idiot. It's bad enough that customer's are rude, but any other department you call for guidance is rude too. 

Have a bad day? Well, everyone is going to know about it. They send out a stack rank email every day with your calls handled, hold time, after call work time and survey score to your entire time. Oh, the survey score scale rating goes like this: Highest score = 100%, and not the highest score = 0%. Seems fair right? Even better, they ask three questions, one of them being satisfaction with rep, and it doesn't even count. The only one you get scored on is the one that asks about their overall experience. 

I understand that this job is just not for some people, as I found out pretty quickly. I was told that advancement could happen quickly, however the path to an off-phone role can take years. This is why so many people seem jaded when I was in training, but I didn't see the red flags quick enough. 

Also, you get a 30 minute break and a 30 minute lunch for an eight hour shift. You have to use your break time to go to the bathroom so it doesn't eat up your after call work and effect your metrics. You pretty much feel like a kindergarten that's being monitored consistently.",3

If you are cognizant enough to see certain situations as opportunities, you can at least gain the experience.

In the past sr. management has funded the important business initiatives.  Still not clear on how this will shake out.   

The technology investment has always been strong.  The implementation has been less that optimal at times.

This poor management performance also prevents line management from removing poor performers.  When its clear that a person is mismatch for the position he/she holds, the line manager does not have the skill/ability to make the change.  This goes on for years on end.

In the IT world, the various organizations have conflicting agendas and business plans.  Very poor coordination if any across the various IT and business organizations.  This causes high costs, high risk and significant inefficiencies.

It used to be that the average Fidelity associate was very passionate about his/her job.  Not so sure now.  Its clear that the new management is shoring up cost containment and streamlining and maybe cleaning out the under performers.  That's just good business, if that is in fact what's happening.

- Industry leading benefits package (health, dental, 401k with 7% match and 10% profit sharing bonus - essentially a 17% match if you contribute 7% to your 401k, tuition reimbursement is $10,000, Company covers most or all of the cost of mass transit passes, etc.)",Cons,"- Benefit package is great at the cost of low base pay compared to industry competitors.
- If you get an MBA or advanced degree, there are virtually no opportunities in SLC to take advantage of that. The only high paying career opportunities are in phone sales and management.  However management has virtually no turnover which is because of the great situation they have (Many have +10 year tenure), but this is bad if you want to try to get into management - be prepared to wait years for that opportunity or be forced to find an opportunity somewhere else.
- For those in SLC who want to move elsewhere in the country most of the opportunities are only for representatives who want to go to branches, if you want to go to a higher value added position in Boston or any other location good luck if you don't have connections or years of experience. Getting an advanced degree while working means nothing if you are trying to get in the door outside of their conventional channel of campus recruiting at mostly Ivy league or east coast universities.",1
"Great in some areas, lacking in others",https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW2693650.htm,3.0,"May 30, 2013",529 College Planning Specialist,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","American Fork, UT",Pros,"Overall good benefits package: medical, dental, retirement. Medical insurance tends to be on expensive side, but coverage was good as well. Retirement benefits are awesome once you actually vest and are eligible for a match.",Cons,"Work environment was lacking. Vacation days (15/year) were okay, but definitely not enough to reward for the amount of work and stress for employees. Amount of sick days (6/year) was absolutely horrendous. A family of 4, like my own, could eat up that amount of time in a matter of months, and I didn't even try to abuse the system.

The area most lacking was employee appreciation. They attempt to appreciate by focusing on some areas (i.e. generous retirement package, perq points, team competitions), but overall falls very short. 

The perq points are based on performance during quarterly competitions. I exceeded goals every competition, but received no more than equivalent of $60 each time. Those who didn't really try and wouldn't meet performance goals would still get about $40 each time. 

My team won about half of the site competitions among teams. We were a very good team. However, the rewards (usually a increase in budget based on head count) would get paid out months after the fact. When it actually did get paid out, for some reason we never seemed to have enough money to do anything fun anyway. Something was amiss in the entire process. Maybe it falls on our manager, maybe the site management. I don't know.

In my 529 college planning specialty role, recently more and more tasks were being added to our plate. It was as if they were using 529 was ""Fidelity Special Forces."" We took on the Canadian Remediation in the summer of 2012, started backing up PAS with their overflow toward the end of 2012, and gradually took more and more general service overflow. When I arrived, 529 had a seasonal workload where it was very heavy during some times of the year, and a little lighter at other times. When I left, we were constantly ""lit"" (meaning calls waiting to get through to us). Most calls we received were general service or something other than 529 calls. The 529 customers were being neglected because we couldn't provide them service in time.

The increased workload would have been fine by me if they would have done a few things:
1. Inform us in advance of how, why, and when the workload is increasing.
2. Provide an increase in compensation (or bonuses or something) since we were not originally hired to do the increased work.
3. Hire more employees to do the peon work of general service. Since they worked us a lot of overtime, you would think that it wouldn't cost as much to hire another employee with a lower salary than to pay me at time-and-a-half with my higher salary.

My last point of review on what was lacking at Fidelity is the career opportunities. Ultimately, EVERYONE needs to go the sales route to accomplish anything. All career paths on the service side reach dead-ends very quickly so employees are stuck with low salaries. My being a non-sales type of person, I realized very quickly that I needed to jump ship. Thankfully, I had the opportunity to take a job I had been wanting to do for a long time. I didn't even blink before I accepted the offer.",1

Very customer focused, which is a pro if you are a customer/client.",Cons,"My manager loves to over coach you to the point you feel as though you are incompetent. There are others that do the same. This is part of the coddling Fidelity does to their clients. If you are in a service role in a phone site you will be expected to place trades that fall into the complicated and varied internal rules that often defy logic. If a client wants to place a trade and you place it without questioning the client on why and how they are wanting to place it, you will be scrutinized. Fidelity's internal trading and distribution rules imply that all of their clients are idiots and we must save them from themselves. If you miss the opportunity to save the client from their own actions you will be charged an error. They will tell you how easy it is to exceed the quarterly bonus and get a full payout, but it is far from the truth. You have to trade error free, have efficient calls, meet sales lead goals, and have positive client surveys. The entire team has to meet their goals in order to maximize payout. Without significant experience most error free traders don't have efficient calls, because they are spending ten minutes a trade to make sure one of the silly rules isn't being violated. If you receive good surveys then your probably not meeting your lead goals, because despite the belief, not every client wants to be probed for opportunities.

The technology community is really helpful and full of such a variety of people. There's good events, they invest in you as a person from internal onsite training, to in-house education platforms to big name course platforming tools (not even counting their benefits package, that's incredible, especially for families). You can really ""Blaze your own trail"" when it comes to your career and people will support you as much as they can. The connections you make there can/will extend far after you leave and most of their networks are very far reaching across other large companies (or even internally).

Additionally, work/life balance is AMAZING. Most managers (particularly technology, since call center workflows are different) will let you handle life because they know that it can be unpredictable, and will help you adjust however works for you (obviously within reason), whether that's having to leave somewhat early to pick up kids or have an extended lunch because of a crisis or appointment. There's a trust that you can develop with your team and manager that you can truly make the experience less stressful, and they're willing to work with you in whatever way they can.",Cons,"If you're coming in as an entry-level technology role, make sure you get the best offer you can. They've historically paid under market even in their industry (though it's much closer these past 2 years) because of their benefits, but total comp is still somewhat lower than anticipated for their size. Depending on the team, it may be hard to rise up the ranks past a point due to too many managers, and organizations find it difficult to cut them, especially if they've been there a while. It's pretty hard to negotiate any pay change since raises only happen at the end of the year, and there's not a pay discussion until they're locked in.",

The employees are the company and make it a worthwhile place to work.  The collegial atmosphere is fantastic, especially in the information technology area.  Information share among colleagues is open and there is a genuine desire to see peers across the various platforms and internal companies succeed.  Collaboration between teams is good.  The infighting, back-stabbing, ""step on each other to get to the top"" mentality is rare.  Those sort of individuals, for the most part, don't last long among the people who are actually productive and get things done at the line levels.  Leadership at the first-line levels is phenomenal.  Some managers are former military service who understand how to lead people to achieve company objectives while showing genuine concern for the well-being and growth of those they lead.  In fairness, the numbers of those types of individuals is shrinking.  The ""silo"" mentality of the different companies within Fidelity and their corresponding initiatives that used to be prevalent throughout Fidelity has greatly diminished over the past several years.",Cons,"While the line level employees and line managers are some of the most competent you will find in the industry for any of the job families that fall under the Fidelity umbrella (trading, finance, information technology, etc.), the executive management fails to understand the talent pools they possess in those areas.  This is readily apparent in the recent turnover among the upper echelons of management and the corresponding restructuring coming to be known as the ""Rodger Lawson"" era by employees.  The executive leadership that built the company over the last 10-15 years is out.  New executive management is in with the focus on cost-cutting that takes no regard for the Fidelity specific institutional knowledge and talent that is a key strength to stability.  The ""private company""  and ""family owned"" environment that made Fidelity a great place to work and employees proud to laud the company to their friends, family and any one who would listen has evaporated.  Executive management failures to properly define goals and thereby engage the talent in the labor pool they possess is abysmal.  Some of the best and brightest with great knowledge and talent were assigned to projects that incoming executive management had no stomach for seeing to completion.  Rather than reassign that best and brightest talent to retain it, a slash and burn has taken place in the form of layoffs in November 2008 that has placed that talent on the market, ripe for other companies to cherry pick.   The new executive management isn't done and layoffs are coming again in first quarter of 2009 to reach some idea of a model organization.  This is definitely throwing the baby out with the bath water.  Consider this an announcement to all other companies, especially in the technology arena.  While the individual writing this commentary was not affected in the Q4/2008 layoffs, there exists an opportunity for you to profit from Fidelity's unfortunate rush to meet a model organization concept.  Those of us that remain at Fidelity will have to suffer through this bungling until a level of equilibrium is achieved and the people that matter, the ones who actually make Fidelity work, can again overcome this idiotic endeavor.  I love the Johnson family.  Over a decade of my life has been spent at Fidelity.  I've seen the good and the bad.  Why the new executive team being brought in by them is thought to be better and brighter than the people that have built the company is a mystery to me.  Rodger Lawson is a retread, having worked at Fidelity before, but many of the executive management being brought in are coming from failed Wall Street companies that are the focus of the recent $700B bailout.  These people are better and brighter than the individuals they replaced?  Many with long track records of productivity in the lower ranks and that have made this company great are less than inspired.  All we see is the continued evaporation of work-life balance and yet another step closer to a sweat-shop.",

- The company is moving away from working in silos; that's a plus for those whose skills lie in developing projects.
- The strength is in the contract people who are serious about their work and are very professional. If you have a choice to work with the contracted groups of people, you're more likely to have a good experience and can minimize interactions with the main tech support people and their management.",Cons,"-  Probably the worst aspect of working at FTG is the ""high school environment"" and complete lack of professionalism. When you begin working there, the environment smacks of high school popularity groups. Yuck! And it only becomes worse with time. As much as one tries to remain professional it is difficult to avoid being pulled or pushed, one way or another.  I watched the group of support staff ostracize a former team member and leader because that person was promoted to a position that was ancillary to the support tasks. As I said, it is like a group of mean girls in high school and the guys just kind of follow along. What a sad environment.

-There are 'team leaders"" within the support group, and those who are serious about getting their work done and doing an excellent job, easily standout from the rest.  Worst seems to be the bizarre nature of relationships between Senior Management and some of the employees who have been around for along time. These ""older"" support workers as it turns out, started at FTG at the same time as their now manger.  However, once the other person was promoted, and now holds a position of superior management over the first worker, the relationship between the two naturally has an uncomfortable strain even if it is not clearly evident to all. What was most obvious to those of us outside of this type of bizarre relationship is that the people still hanging around among the worker bees could easily see the passive aggressive behavior. In addition when a fresh new employee full of ideas is assigned to work with one of these people, the older worker bees exploit the new employees mercilessly. Since the newcomers are likely on the outside of the group of people, they don't stand a chance and if anything doesn't go as planned, the newcomers end up getting reprimanded by Senior Mgmt. in place of the worker bees. This ultimately creates a watch out for #1 environment in addition to the vicious ""get rid of #2"" nature of the workers. If you work there, always watch your back - trust no one - be friendly, but make no friends - and document everything you do to CYA.

- Poor leadership in management - mgmt. often does not realize (chooses not to realize?)  who is actually shouldering the work and who is slacking off. The nature of the ""you're in"" vs. ""you're out"" environment only serves to undermine anyone speaking up.

- Higher ups laid off the better managers in late 2008; all that left is those who don't draw healthy boundaries nor can they manage their own people because they have way too much on their plates.

- FTG component of Fidelity is shifting more and more of its human resources & capital over to India. The people we support are becoming increasingly frustrated with this as the quality of service decreases. Senior Management is aware of this but puts on a happy face to avoid being laid off as their own counterparts were.",

I'm constantly impressed at the depth of knowledge at FMR (can't speak for other business units, but reference my ""Cons"").  I've worked at other firms and constantly feel that I work with some of the best and smartest people in the industry.  

Working for FMR (as opposed to other business units within Fidelity) is a real plus too.",Cons,"It seems that compensation tends to be less competitive (at least in the non-supervisory roles).  I think Fidelity recognizes that their name cache on your resume is ""value enough"" in their eyes for future opportunities outside of the the company.

Because Fidelity has so many seperately managed business units under the ""Fidelity Investments"" umbrella, the cultures can vary widely.  I've interacted with some employees in other business units (outside of FMR) who seem to have a very relaxed work environment (""think I'll leave at 3 today...it's Friday, and it's so nice outside!"") or generally seem to be less impressive on a talent level-- some business units' Directors or even VPs are less qualified/knowledgable than many of the non-managers in FMR.

It pays rather well considering that you don't need much experience beyond customer service to get hired here. Fidelity also embraces diversity and community service.",Cons,"This company has an uncomfortably cult like environment. Everyone has to put on an air of completely loving Fidelity and loving their job like they are brainwashed robots; if you don't play along, you will have problems. If you want to reveal your true feelings about the job, or you have something remotely negative to say, think carefully about who to confide in. It's actually pretty vital to be over the top pro-Fidelity if you want any chance of transferring around or getting a promotion one day. However, plenty of people still don't get to move around or get the promotions that they deserve because they don't act brainwashed enough and/or they're so good that they are kept trapped in the call center forever. Some managers have all but lost their call center skills and they basically serve as cheerleader coaches. They might ""coach"" you on what to say, but rarely will get on the phone themselves and have lost touch with what the job entails.

In the call center you are micro-managed severely. Co-workers and managers will sit down with you and pick apart your calls word for word. You'll be invited to pick apart other calls as well. Every second on the job is recorded and timed. If your call extends into your lunch break or you have to take an extra bathroom break, you'll be out of adherence which you will be reprimanded for and which will affect your next bonus. Your bonus is completely up to your manager's discretion, by the way, which has quite a few implications. Your team will compete with other teams to have the best stats and you will receive judgment for yours, even though most of it seems nonsensical and/or out of your control.

Orientation frames the job as pretty great. You have a blast with your new co-workers and are spoiled with fun activities and long lunches. But once you are out on the floor and the novelty has worn off, you see the job is more about statistics than anything else. Customer service is heavily emphasized in conversation, yet all that really counts is call lengths, schedule adherence, how much your manager likes you, being fanatically pro-Fidelity, and being subjected to constant and excessive micro-managing and taking it all with a smile and nod. 

It's hard not to even have the support of your co-workers. The gossiping is incredible. For some, this place is really their life's career and they will never leave, so you must be careful about what you say about the company and you have to navigate the strange drama of people who have worked there for years. There are also so many people in the call center that you will regularly have other people's mistakes dumped on to you via a livid customer and/or will find that co-workers don't care to take a transfer or help you during a difficult call. Burnout here tends to make people curt and apathetic toward each other, which is no fun when you have a customer on the line and a manager who's constantly looking to find fault in your actions. I constantly felt stranded. 

I should mention that the job itself of answering calls is not easy. In short, there is an entire book behind every retirement plan. You have customers throwing all sorts of crazy and complex questions at you while you have to stall for time while browsing an extensive encyclopedia of information. You will find that your resources are incomplete, confusing, way too elaborate, and/or misleading on a regular basis, which renders a lot of stressful and difficult calls. Have I mentioned all the abuse you have to swallow from customers? They are way worse than customers face-to-face. Some days you feel like you are being attacked on all sides. 

Although everyone has to act like Fidelity is utterly amazing, give it enough time and you'll see what's really going on - the nonsensical promotions, people becoming trapped in the call center - denied every opportunity to take a new position, and unable to leave the company because they have no transferable skills - people's relief to get off the phones whenever allowed, the apathy, etc. it's depressing. It's the unhappiest work environment for a customer service job because you have to act completely fake all the time with everyone you work with and every single thing you say and do is watched and usually ripped apart by co-workers and managers. I had a lot of awful days on this job and was so happy to get ou. 

I guess this place is okay if you have no other options and/or you like being micro-managed in a corporate cult. Otherwise steer clear.",24

For the first few years, there really seemed to be a Fidelity culture, we were all proud to be working at such a great company with such integrity.

Fast forward to today, currently two year in the ""salaried"" position and miserable. I am doing the work of three people because they won't back fill our department, we work some times 80 or more hours a week just to stay on top of what is put in front of us. The promised ""big"" raises, we were told was nixed from above. The morale is horrible. I have been sick more than I care to mention from the stress. I entered this role knowing very little about the position and there wasn't any training, I was handed 130 clients to start with and told, you'll figure it out. My laptop has never worked properly, mail doesn't go out or come in all the time, to name one of the many issues, no one knows how to fix it, nor will they replace it.  I never thought I would say this about Fidelity, but I do feel like a number. I have talked to many of my co-workers in other groups who are feeling the same way, so it's not just the group I am in. Right now, until I can find (or have time to find) another job, it's just a paycheck, not a career.",24

~Education reimbursement. Will pay 90% of CFP certification.
~Health benefits are good, but a bit expensive, and in order to reduce the expense quarterly, you must engage in an online ""wellness"" program.
~High volume business allows for lots of opportunities to hone in your investment and retirement planning skills.",Cons,"We are hired for our past successes in planning, sales and relationship management, but then mircro managed and questioned for every single action beyond belief. It is hard to work here and maintain a sense of self respect and dignity! 
~Phone calls are listened-in on by management, and then your conversation with an existing elderly client is called in to question, like, why did you waste 5 minutes talking to her, continuing to build that ""relationship"", and looking up the status of the TOA for her, when you simply could have forwarded her to the call center cust service team? Seriously? Every rep in my branch has suffered a similar type of encroachment.
~Management will occasionally either sit in to observe an appointment, or they will have you dial their extension and listen remotely from their office phone. It is an arbitrary and random decision as to which appointments they ""join"", but really, nothing shakes the confidence of a HNW prospect more than thinking the advisor they are here to see is undergoing some sort to management oversight!! It doesn't matter how well the manager justifies it to the prospect, they are thinking, ""run""!! Every rep in my branch has suffered a failed appointment due to this hideous micro-management.
~Fidelity preaches the relationship model, putting the customer needs first, holistic financial planning, blah blah, then really only cares about what products you ""sold"" to each client. Management is very very short-sighted. An appt where you meet with a multi-million $ prospect preparing for retirement in a few months, building the relationship, developing trust, laying ground work for all future wealth planning, is not regarded as a successful appointment or very good use of your time, because it did not result in actual ""business"" today.
~Fidelity is bombarding their clients with a never-ending barrage of email, mail, just non-stop marketing, all on the S/AE behalf, which drives most clients absolutely nuts.
~They only care about whether or not you are completing the menial ""tasks"", like clicking all the appropriate buttons in siebel. You are tracked and watched and measured on every single little thing you can imagine. How many clicks you clicked. How many times you dialed out...And all your numbers that are tracked are not only to ensure you are being a busy little bee, but the manager is rated on how many little clicks and menial tasks his/her advisors are doing. It's really all about how to make the manager look good to his/her manager!
~Management at the branch level is extremely lame. They want to treat you like a child, and keep you fearful, knowing every little move is being tracked and watched. Like I said, it is hard to maintain a sense of dignity and self respect in an environment like this. Those who can brown nose management, and are otherwise spiteful, political and backstabbing (to fellow colleagues) do well here. Success is: just tell management what they want to hear, and slam clients into products to satisfy management... Those with little talent and integrity stay, endure, and ultimately get promoted, perpetuating the bad leadership. They stay, put up with the games, and endure because they realize they could not make it anywhere else (except, perhaps, on a used car lot). Those with talent, integrity and truly good planning skills leave for a saner environment. 
~Clients in the S/AE book are very frustrated by the fact that every time they get assigned a new S/AE, and they happen to like that advisor and feel that they are working with someone with knowledge and integrity, that advisor ends up leaving. They keep getting turned over, until ultimately, they will end of in the book of one of the talentless, low-integrity bozos that never leave, or, they will just TOA out of Fido.
~Management, by their own admission, have never worked in our S/AE role as it is currently designed. The ""relationship"" model is relatively new, and as reps, they only served customers that were fed to them by the ""green machine"" on a transactional, not relationship, model. I think that disconnect helps explain the double standard; why they focus on tracking/forcing transactional business while falsely preaching relationship development. They like to talk about how successful ""they"" were in the role...but yeah, if all I had to do was take inbound calls and leads, roll the assets over and slap the client in PAS, funds, and/or FILI, then just move on to the next one with no follow up or relationship accountability...well, heck, any moron could do that.",22

Pay is minimal and management has poor communication over all.  Actually that's not true, they have NO communication over all.  You are always being monitored.  What I mean by this is that all the calls are listened to and graded, if you stop calls to go to the bathroom, it counts against you.  If you don't take your break/lunch EXACTLY at the specified time, it counts against you.  If you're stuck on a long call and you go past your break time, you're SOL.  And it counts against you.   The computers are so old and constantly freeze and crash on you, which gets increasingly frustrating everyday.  You would think for a multi-million dollar company they could provide their minions with some semi-functional equipment in order to do their jobs efficiently.  But I guess not.  Fidelity also boasts about all the opportunities they have for their employees to branch out to, and frankly the opportunities are few and far between.  They sell you the dream.  And even if you are lucky enough to get a different position, you'll still be on the phone all day taking ~60+ calls per day.  The job descriptions are very vague as to what you'll be doing.  And the little information that is conveyed is very deceitful.   No where was it ever made clear that this is a call center.  Had I known this, I wouldn't even have applied.  I did not go to college to work in a call center.  PLEASE do not apply here!!  Run far and fast!  If you really want to work at a call center, find a different one.  Do your future self a favor and DO NOT WORK HERE!  You WILL regret it.  You'll be thinking about this review while you are sitting at your desk and be thinking ""why, why didn't I listen to this person!""  This job was such a joke and a stain on my resume.",22

I held many positions and learned a lot in each.,Cons,Pay is low and career advancement (upwards) is difficult. Promotions are almost impossible to get. Management does not recognize the outstanding work that their employees do. Re-orgs are very common every 6 months or so.  Your manager never really gets opportunity to know you and your skills.,3

Branch environment feels like a small business but has the perks of corporate world.,Cons,Upper Management tends to make poor decisions when hiring a branch manager. Recent manager hired for downtown Denver office has no industry knowledge and is strictly sales driven. Demands to have total control of all situations and has lost trust of employees. Fidelity preaches of putting the client first and being customer focused but he feels the opposite about it.,
Undervalued and Overworked,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW14662729.htm,1.0,"Apr 17, 2017",Workplace Planning and Guidance,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Merrimack, NH",Pros,"Great benefits.
Job security - second to none. Working in Finance and providing guidance or customer service is a job that only gets more secure as the economy gets worse.",Cons,"Completely undervalued - we were told for over 1 year that we would get raises and we did not. All the other groups in my business function received pay raises, and 3 or 4 other functions in the company did the same job as my group, and they got paid 20-50% more. The only time I felt like anyone cared that I was working my tail off was when I announced that I was quitting.
Overworked - you are tethered to your phone, and you are required to take inbound calls constantly. It is a call center.
""Sales"" - you are consistently told that you are in a sales function, you have a quota to hit, and you are held to metrics. However, you have no control over what phone calls you take or what customers you talk to, and the environment and pay are not reflective of a sales function.
Pay - the pay was pathetic compared to the rest of the industry/rest of the company.
Budget cuts - we were not allowed to work overtime, but our sales goals were raised.
Inconsistency - calls were transferred to my function by other sales roles. Those sales roles had very little idea what customers needed or wanted, and we were restricted from giving any type of pushback. We were required to take all calls that came to us, regardless of whether the customer's questions were in our job description.
Promoting based on politics - I saw multiple instances of people getting promoted that did not deserve the job. There was an explicit instance that I witnessed where someone was hired into a position because they were a woman, even though they were less qualified than another candidate (who happened to be male) - management made an explicit comment that they wanted to hire a woman to the position.",19

There are a lot of ways to get involved with your coworkers. Though we are in operations, you get the feeling that everyone is working toward the same goals, and bottom level associates are made to feel valued",Cons,"Despite the numerous attempts at holding talent, Fidelity's flaw is a static career. Very limited mobility internally if you're looking to pursue a new career since so many reps are just trying to get off of the phone calls they take daily.",

Poor technology practices,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW16930693.htm,1.0,"Sep 20, 2017",Senior Software Developer,"Former Employee, more than 8 years",,Pros,The 401k in the USA is pretty good. You should get a return above 6% of thereabouts. No reason you won't have over $100k in your 401k account after 5 years. This is the only pro to working at this company.,Cons,"If you're looking for a technology position, I would go to a technology company. Fidelity is a financial services company first, and as a result they have some questionable practices. They have their own version of agile which just doesn't work. Be prepared for hour long stand ups in the morning, project managers that are not technical and fail to keep track of meeting minutes.

From a salary perspective Fidelity is way behind technology companies. I left a senior position in Fidelity, and joined a junior position in a technology company. My salary went from $74,800 to $120,000. 

Once you get to senior in Fidelity, the path to principal, manager, director and above is almost non-existant these days. Your promotion path is not based on job performance, it is based on putting the time in with the group you're with. This much was admitted to me in my review meetings. If you join as a senior or get promoted to senior and want to be promoted to principal be prepared to put in more than 5 years before even being considered for it, and chances are the company will use a down turn in the economy as a reason for not giving you the promotion you deserve.

If you're near retirement you'll be fired so the company can save money by not giving you a full retirement package. I know a lot of people that this happened to in 2008, and again recently. 

The company keeps changing direction. When I joined in 2007 teams were organized by function - developers, testers, etc. Recently they re-organized by product. You can be sure in another 6 - 8 years they'll go back to being organized by function after an independent consultant comes in and makes the case for it.

Every 8 years the company sheds around 10 - 25% of their staff - most of them are the people it pays the most.",19
Systems Engineer - Fidelity Investments,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW17573084.htm,5.0,"Oct 26, 2017",Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,Pros,"Great benefits, great environment, beautiful campus.",Cons,Common judgment performance rating system requires  at least 1 person from each team to receive unsatisfactory performance. Our team was only 3 people so only one person could get exceptional performance and one had to get unsatisfactory regardless of actual performance. We rotated but still taking a negative review because of a flawed system is unacceptable.,
Financial Representative - an exciting career talking to angry customers on the phone.,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW17668511.htm,1.0,"Nov 1, 2017",Financial Representative,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",,Pros,"The pay is decent, the benefits are good, after 6 months you are eligible to begin having your student loans reimbursed. Fidelity puts a substantial amount of effort into training you to pass the series 7 and series 63 tests.",Cons,"Beyond training you to pass the series 7 and series 63, Fidelity doesn’t really train you for the job you will be performing. 
Most, if not all jobs, are customer facing phone center jobs. Half your time will be spent dealing with angry customers. Most of the time they were told the wrong way to transfer money, or otherwise service their account, by a poorly trained rep. Other times, a form will be rejected and instead of Fidelity sending an email or making a call, a poorly worded letter will be sent advising the customer to call the general service line instead of the back office group that can actually help with the problem. 
Prepare to be micromanaged. In an eight hour shift, you will get one paid 30 minute break and one unpaid 30 minute lunch. Other than that, you are expected to be on the phone. You will receive “coaching” from your manager if you spend too much time writing notes on an account, if you don’t enroll enough people in the voice recognition system, if you call the help desk too much because you don’t know how to help the customer, if your calls are longer than ten minutes, if you don’t take at least 6.5 calls in an hour, or if you don’t get enough new business leads. Also, your job performance will be judged based on what customers think of you. Customer surveys must be “top box” for them to count toward your bonus.  If you help a customer who was given bad information by a previous rep, even if you resolve the issue, if they’re still unhappy with the overall service Fidelity gave them (which they usually are), you get a poor evaluation. That poor evaluation is then used to assess how much of a bonus you get.
After passing the series 7 and 63 you get a retention bonus. Meaning, if you work at Fidelity for less than a year after receiving the bonus, you have to pay it back. This was put into place because of the huge amount of turnover that takes place once reps are done with the training and start the actual job.
Additionally, you will be taught how to avoid giving anything that resembles investment advice by directing customers back to the website for almost everything.",19

Positive coaching and training.  Easy work/life balance.  Plenty of room to grow.  Company covers all licensing requirements.  The company is expanding rapidly and earning a lot of new business.,Cons,Upward growth requires a flexible night shift one night per week.

I was at Fidelity for several years -- in the beginning I was excited to be there, and I got great reviews and I moved up, and I did meet some really good people, so I thought there was a future there for me. But after seeing behind the curtain and realizing every part of the business was messed up, I jumped ship when the opportunity presented itself.

In every business unit I was in, I saw a shocking lack of leadership. Projects are started and stopped in a haphazard, wasteful way based on whichever direction the political wind is blowing. Projects take years to complete when they shouldn't, and sometimes things launch and then they are immediately discarded. Or subpar work -- the standards, when you are talking about technology or communications or design, are way too low for a company of this size and reputation -- is allowed to launch and is weirdly celebrated. The website is terrible, and the technology at Fidelity is frighteningly behind, yet they spend billions on it every year.

Many VPs (and there are oh-so-many) are afraid to say what they think, so naturally everyone underneath them is. People who move slowly and don't make waves are rewarded. People who suggest new ways to approach things are often viewed as threatening by people who have been sitting comfortably in their roosts for too long. Very little actual work gets done and I think Fidelity customers would be shocked to see how much money is wasted by this company on people who are paid way too much for producing way too little by the end of the year. Typically you'll see a business unit with a couple of overworked worker bees and several VPs who go to a lot of meetings but don't do much except talk at each other in meetings and try to figure out how to work the politics.

HR is obsessed with the upper echelon of management, and could care less about the employees. They'll drive themselves crazy over how some memo looks to Executive A or all the SVPs and meanwhile they put very little forethought into a relocation strategy that affects thousands of employees and will bite them in the long run. For example, how many future genius fixed income portfolio managers will sign up to work in Merrimack, New Hampshire when they can go to the competitors in New York or London? And how many dollars is this firm saving by outsourcing HTML work to India when the work takes three times as long to be completed because every single piece of it must be explained, checked, and then checked and requested three more times until it is correct (and each round takes 2 weeks)?

The word on the street is with the up-and-coming leadership regime, it's all about the yes-men, and there's no heart there. Some of the old benefits have already disappeared, and most of the people in the know expect that when the Chairman retires, his successor wants to get rid of things like the long-loved employee shares. Believe me, this will happen. 

This company loves layers, and insecure management lets incompetence reign in those layers -- especially directors and VPs -- because they can manipulate those employees or because they're too afraid to fire people who are in over their heads. Management and HR love to market to themselves internally.

Yet Fidelity will continue to make money in spite of this because it has reached a certain size in the marketplace. When I left, I took my money with me because after seeing how the sausage is made, this really isn't the best place to put your money. (Unless you are a high net-worth customer, they push you into the Freedom Funds, which are consistent underperformers.)

It's sad, because from what I understand from people who were there for a really long time, it used to be a really great company. This sentiment is heard around the firm, but I know a lot of people are afraid to leave because they're shackled to the benefits.

Life is short -- there are a lot of companies out there. If you're not overly committed to your kids' private schools or college tuitions, get the heck out while you still can. There is a world outside Fidelity.",17

The facilities are nice and some of your coworkers can be friendly. Training and L&D structure is quite good.,Cons,"Incompetent management who are only around to spy on employees every waking moment of the day. They drill you with metrics and are quick to point out the negative aspects of your performance while glossing over any positive aspects. For example, you could be leading your team in trade accuracy yet they will berate you for the fact you take a few extra seconds in between calls to wrap things up. Your metrics suffer if you have to use the restroom when you aren't on a break (often times you go a 3 or 3.5-hour stretch without one). Your schedule is outside of your control and offers no room for any leeway (I would always have break and lunch at different times every single day of the week). If you work on a schedule where you have to work on weekends there is almost zero chance of you ever getting a Saturday or Sunday off. Many of your coworkers and managers are rude, narcissistic egoists who will do anything to get ahead. There is almost no room for upward mobility if you start in the call center - something made very clear early on. It's just an endless line of phone jobs, finding a spot where you aren't working on the phone is exceedingly rare. Despite the fact that it does pay well, reps are still underpaid for the amount of work they must do. Full traders are almost always sitting in a position where there are 20+ calls holding all day for the entire 10 hour shift. Soul-crushing monotony with zero work/life balance, this job will inevitably make you wish you would get in a fatal car accident on the way in to work.",17

-Expected to work lots of OT in sales jobs.
-Lower Pay than comparable jobs.
-Very tedious and repetitive for most phone sales positions.
-Manager half the time doesn't even know your role so that can't help or teach you other than to tell you to work harder, more OT, or give suggestions that have no tangible merit behind them. Part of that is because of the change that happens so often and never gives groups stability within the company.
-Worked there for six years and only ever knew the people directly around me.  Its ironic as you talk to people all day yet you don't get to know anyone at the job unless your in a higher up positions where you have more leeway to be off the phone for a few minutes.
-Entry job is into service group is awful, super strict on when you can go to lunch, break.  Basically no flexibility.

Only positive,Cons,"The firm constantly states how conservative and honest they are, but that is only in regards to their clients, not employees.  Upper management constantly lies about anything and everything.  False promises across the board.  Stated that simply working a full calendar year qualifies you for their 10% profit sharing payout.  After a year of work, told we wouldn't be receiving the payment because we missed the ""deadline"" that was never mentioned.  When speaking to managers/directors about why this was never mentioned to us, simply told that ""you should have received it.""

Promotions are just lateral moves.  Want you to assist their customers on the phone, but if they talk to much it ruins your metrics and you get yelled at for it.  Nothing is done to problem customers.  You will spend an hour on the phone calling the Risk group about a blocked account for someone who a negative balance with the company.  Of course you can't hang up on them either.  Don't let them lie to you about how you're a ""financial professional.""  Very little finance, everything about appeasing their horrible client base.

""Promotions"" are almost constantly handed to the most unqualified applicants.  It isn't what you know or how well you perform within your role, its all about how big of a shill you can be for the company.  

When applying for a new position, every female candidate will be promoted regardless.  This trend can be seen throughout the whole company.  Women make up maybe 10% of Personal Investing but when it comes to manager roles its around 70/30 Female to Male.  

If you're looking to get sponsored for your 7/63, work here for the 2 months it takes to get them and then leave like everyone else.  Turnover rate is rampant.  Pay is garbage and no one is looking out for you.  Wait for the near future for more layoffs.  Vanguard is taking all of Fidelity's clients and no one is safe from the chopping block.",16

-Good benefits. 
-Very nice campus! 
-They don't hire for upper positions outside of the company.",Cons,"-VERY VERY MICROMANAGED! Get ready to feel like you're in middle school.
-They don't really tell you in the interview that it's just a call center. 
-They do not pay enough nor do they negotiate salaries. Everyone starts off at $38k no matter your experience. So you will make the same as the recent college grad that started with you. 
-What they expect you to know and the quality of work they expect does not match the pay.
-Very very corporate! Management cares about you as a worker- not a person. They only care about you as long as it affects them. 
-If it's super busy, be ready to lose your voice. This is an inbound call center and the calls just come in. You're not picking up the phone. You get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. If you decide that your throat hurts or you have to use the bathroom outside of your two breaks, be ready to hear about how you violated the ""call avoidance policy"" which can eventually get you fired. 
-Even when you pass the series 7 & series 66, you only make 6-8 thousand more- which puts you at $44k-$46k.
-When you first start here, you have to work 12-8:30pm. This isn't a huge deal except for the fact that they make all the newer people work noon-8:30 but everyone else goes home at 5pm leaving you with not much support.
-Team leads WILL NOT take your 'angry customer' calls. They just tell you what to say - which only frustrates customers more. 
-You must have diabetes or low blood pressure to switch your lunch. 
-They don't hire for upper positions outside of the company. This is a pro and a con.  It's a con because these managers are being brought up from a system that has a lot of flaws but by that time, they've bought in to the things that need change whereas someone in upper management from the outside could see it a lot sooner and do something about it. 
-They do not believe in fun here. ""Fun"" means buying a pizza and juice that you can try to eat if it's slow in between calls or on your lunch.",16

When call volume goes up the managers have less to do and can be seen watching youtube or congregating around a desk talking about their children. Their success depends on their teams metrics but the metrics are a crap shoot for the most part. Being promoted is all politics - its about who you know and how hard you can suck up. That may just be how the world works and I am just naive, but this is certainly not a meritocracy.

Metrics - It is understandable that a call center would have metrics, but even the best employees will miss them. They are arbitrary numbers that management places too much weight on.

Faceless Corporation - There is no room for personality, uniqueness, or creativity. Maybe a symptom of a highly regulated industry but feels more like the policies of a faceless corporation.

Monotonous - This is a call center. You take calls. All day. If you are seen taking a break out of schedule you will be told that what ever you are doing can wait till your scheduled break.

Pay - TIAA CREF offers the same position for better pay, more relaxed environment, and more reasonable metrics. They are snatching people from our offices left and right.",15

Perks are okay.,Cons,"My rating is purely based on my experience in Fidelity’s IT department specifically in plan admin group.
I had horrible experiences in this group, primarily because of all the politics that goes around. The modus operandi for this group is traditional command and control in the today’s world where openness, collaboration, and team work is paramount for being successful in competitive world. There is reverse discrimination (discrimination based on ethnicity by Indian managers toward Indian worker), ignorance of meaning of word ‘leadership’, age based discrimination, and disregards of person’s ability/skills/experience.
Reverse Discrimination: I have experience a constant reminder that am Indian and shouldn’t forget that where I come from. Don’t think you would be treated equal, just because you are working in US along with US workers. I would still latch on the fear tactics, which is based on fear of numbers (i.e. don’t care what you bring to the table, I would replace you with a cheap labor from India), to make you submissive. Only when you are submissive, then you will be given anything (responsibility, promotion, raise, bonuses etc.). Otherwise forget about it. How are can you be creative, and realize your potential when you are being force in submission by your leadership? What a paradox!
Leadership: Middle managers (VP & Below) don’t get the meaning of leadership. Leadership is about bringing out the best from each individual not force him/her into submission, and then use them as labor. They are uninspiring, have no stewardship, have no contextual awareness, and bully. I have seen people going into clinical depression who have worked there for many years, and gave best their lives to the company. These managers have no regards for that, and have no idea how to inspire people to actualize themselves. They are micromanager because they don’t know how to create value for businesses which would create value for themselves as well as value for people working for them.
Age based discrimination: Managers discriminate people with higher age because they can smell nonsense from a mile. Uninspiring leadership would naturally resolve to tactics of command & control, carrot & sticks, and God knows what else. One weapon in their armor is to fire aged guys 35 & above and hire young one for cheap. Instead of leveraging experience, and skills of senior person, they are condemned to dark roads after giving best years of their lives to the organization.
Disregard for skill/knowledge/experience: Doesn’t matter how highly educated you are or what skills do you have or what experience you have, you still be treated like a labor. There is no decentralization of decision making, empowering the team, or given chances to advance your career.
Politics: Highly political environment. Sometimes it felt like we are not in business world but in political world, where pulling one another down by any means necessary is fair game. In my opinion, the deep reason for such behavior is fear of losing job. Subconsciously, that fear brings out protectionist tendencies, and creates unfair environment. Below is tactics for harassing people.
•	Don’t let them talk to business folk – red tape.
•	Don’t let them have their vacations when they want.
•	Don’t communicate expectation from the job. Keep vague definition of roles and responsibilities so that they can be mended and used against people to break them down mentally.
•	Act like a bully for people who don’t agree with your idea. Typical Indian way of working. Create gang of unskilled sycophants to intimidate others by show of force.
•	Always criticize, never appreciate.
•	Don’t clearly communicate goals, vision, or strategy for the group. I most certainly think that they have idea what these means, or how value creation process work.",14

You are punished if you don't take enough calls (if you work an 8 hour shift, and take less than 50 phone calls that day, that is considered not meeting your goal). Management will coach you to take more calls than breaths you take. They present all of this in a way that sounds advantageous to you, but in reality it is just another corporation out to make the most money for themselves, and risk the sanity of their employees for that. 
The expectations change almost weekly. It's impossible to keep up with them.
Management will make you feel like you suck at your job before acknowledging that the things they request are unrealistic. AKA taking 8-10 calls per hour just to get a little above the bare minimum on the bonus scale.
""Coaching"" is not really coaching. They aren't ""helping you grow"" they are basically reading from the most generic customer service model.

The compensation is insulting. I went to a competitor in asset management for the same role level and tripled my compensation. You could probably quadruple your compensation by going to amazon, google, etc. A senior software engineer with 10yrs of experience at fidelity makes less than an entry-level software engineer at JP morgan/bank of america/goldman sachs with no years of experience. Don't work here unless you are in asset management. Those are the only people who make any real money.

The tech is severely outdated. Some engineers were working in COBOL while I was there. Once again, this is insulting and shows that no effort is made by management to invest in good tech. 

Management makes it very clear that technologists provide negative value, we were even told this during out first week. ""You are a cost center"" -- I can't tell you how many times I've heard this. It's so obvious. Why do you think there are barely any technologists in the Boston HQ? Instead they're pushed to the basements of New Hampshire and Rhode Island.

Bonus is insulting too. Don't count on that. 

People brag about the generous 401k match but it doesn't kick in for 5 years. That is 5 years you could be working as a technologist at a competing asset manager making triple your compensation. 

My first week at Fidelity a manager told me that technologists are expendable because their job can just be outsourced. Ouch.

This company has no path forward. Mutual funds are a thing of the past now that low-fee ETFs have become so popular. And their brokerage is so outdated.",13

They hire right out of college. Work-sponsored outings are a delight. Great facilities, beautiful campus, on-site Starbucks is the greatest perk of all. Friendly coworkers. Pretty packaging for what proves to be quite an awful deal.",Cons,"Customer service representative work and culture is truly toxic, mentally taxing, entirely sedentary, and unsettlingly monitored by management. You are physically chained to your desk by a phone set for nine hours a day, and provided with two 15-minute breaks and one 30-minute break, all of which are timed by the tracking system. 

There's a big sentiment of favoritism that guides promotions, bonuses, and on the flip side - verbal / written warnings. You don't need to be able to think in order to excel in this role, you just need to be able to follow chain of command and avoid questioning anything. Voicing your opinion will always work against you.

For anyone who studied finance / econ / business, be warned: this is NOT a finance job in any capacity. You will not learn anything about the financial service industry by being here - unless you move into a licensed role, in which you'll really only be able to learn about the industry to pitch the same handful of Fidelity products that benefit the company, so it's really just a glorified sales role. I work with many people who previously worked in grocery stores, coffee shops, or retail shops, who never went to college. It doesn't matter what you know - if anything, it'll benefit you to avoid all forms of thinking whatsoever, as Fidelity does not value ideas, only obedience. 

Your schedule is monitored by a system that quantifies every second you spend on / off the phone into performance metrics that determine your fate at the company. Do not drink too much water at your desk. If you take bathroom breaks, it'll harm your metrics and your manager will have to talk to you and possibly issue a warning. Management speaks like they ""want to help you"", but they really want to help themselves climb the Fidelity ladder, and couldn't care less about their expendable employee base. Pay is very low for a financial services industry job...customer service reps are barely making $38k. And this was after a much-raved about ""pay increase"" that we should've been so humbled and honored to receive, for the grueling work we struggle through. 

Coaching sessions are torturous. You'll be placed in a room with your manager and possibly two to three other colleagues, to listen to each others calls, and tear them apart to bits. You are expected to adhere to a call structure and parrot the same lines, check off a certain number of transfers to certain departments, pitch a certain number of ""contribution increases"" to bring more money to Fidelity at the customer's expense. Managers never tell you what you did well on calls, only what you did poorly. It's not that we don't want feedback and to improve - but sometimes, we did some really nice things on the calls and want to be recognized for our positives too.

Minor technicalities are a guaranteed pull down the rabbit hole of warnings. If you have a technical error, the quality team screens more of your calls, notifies your manager, and you get a ""verbal warning"". They'll screen exponentially more of your calls than they do for anyone else, so that they catch more mistakes you made that everyone else makes too - regardless of how minimal they may be, the repercussions escalate very quickly. Management gets excited to prosecute their employees and never looks at the full situation when quality provides feedback. Half the time, they don't even read their emails or listen to the call, just issue a warning because you ""messed up,"" and they don't care about your side of the story. Sometimes if you try to explain, they'll ask you to stop talking.

If you start in a phone center, you will end in a phone center. Before you begin working, management will pitch to you that the ""sky's the limit"" with career growth in the company, but they don't tell you about the red tape that stands between you and the sky. Fidelity sucks people in for years and years, until they don't have any speakable skills to pitch anywhere outside the company because they've been on the phones for so long, and they're stuck there. It's a culture run by unfair management who talks down to you like you're an incompetent toddler. You will be overworked, underpaid, and undervalued for all the efforts at self-betterment in this job, as it all goes to waste. If they like you, they like you. If they don't, nothing will change that. Either way, get out of there sooner rather than later. The brand name that Fidelity provides isn't worth the mental and emotional suffering of their customer service work.",11

Don't get me wrong, the benefits are good: 7% 401(k) matching, 10% profit sharing, good quality of life (at 5PM on the spot the place is like a stampede,) and rarely do vacations get cancelled.",Cons,"* Low pay. Fidelity's attractiveness comes from their retirement package but, at the end of the day, the base salary is comparatively low and it does NOT make up for the profit sharing or the additional 4% 401(k) matching contributions. I've been testing the market for a while and found out that I could easily be making 15-20% more (base salary) anywhere else. If you're considering getting a job here, be careful with the trade off because FI does NOT like, and rarely gives out, salary increases.

* Affirmative Action central. Whether you like it or not, there's a surplus of testosterone among Wall Street management levels. It's no secret. So FI has embarked in a program to even things out, which means that most of the people getting promoted as of lately are females and/or minorities. 

* Shady stuff going on. I've seen things that are outright a-legal. I can't say it was illegal because I was not privy to the final product but, having taken countless compliance classes (which you are required to take on an annual basis,) that we are exposed to this BS in such a in-your-face manner is really irritating.

* Management has ZERO people skills. There's a manager in our department that is well known to NOT like to work with other men (everybody knows this,) and he has zero men working with him. Instead of this raising a red flag, it is tolerated an even joked about as if it were... normal. In addition, when hired, I was told that the manager was looking for people to speak up in meetings... only to find out that they seems to promote the polar opposite. This seems to be ""The Norm"" at Fidelity: Say one thing, do another. There's... I don't know how to describe it... just a ""shady"" feel to the way they do business. I wouldn't be surprised if FI is in the news one day for having broken some kind of SEC rule soon. Case and point: A colleague of mine recently quit the company. His manager set up an exit interview to find out what the reasons for his departure were. They were in the conference room for 45 minutes and, according to my colleague, the manager did 95% of the talking. This is the kind of craziness you will be dealing with if you join FI.",11

The agreed hiring quota far exceeds business needs. Fidelity manages to meet the quota, yet at the same time, save their budget by making sure that employee turnover is pretty high in this office. Instead of spreading in-coming calls evenly among associates, they create separate work units called MU's. A particular MU receives ALL incoming calls with other MU's receiving only spill over workload. As a result, people quit constantly in the overloaded MU who are then replaced by newly recruited associates.
Other questionable business practices also exist in this office. People are randomly given additional reponsibilities or promotions with the promise that they will receive increased pay commensurate with their added duties. Months later, promoted employees are still waiting for their increased pay. The excuse by management is that they are still waiting to see if you can actually do the job. Instead of a salary increase, they try to placate these employees by decreasing their workload by dumping their duties on the overloaded MU. This is a widespread practice throughout this office. They also hire people at level I and give them Level III duties once you are in the job with Level I pay.
Because of the widespread unemployment situation employees grit their teeth and put up with the situation until they can find another job. In my experience with local and international organizations, I have never seen such dishonest business practices as witnessed in this office. It is truly regrettable that organizations can actually get away with such behavior right here in the United States.

It is all about what the account executives are doing with the clients money. Get that money invested at all costs. Stick 'em in mutual funds, annuities or PAS managed program so they can charge them fees. Fidelity investors do not realize they are being duped by purchasing their no load funds. Why? Because their funds tend to have higher turnover ratios that in turn allow their fund managers to perform trades. This equates to significant trading costs that are not disclosable under current law. Investors only see the fund expenses and forget the hidden fees. Do you really think they are going to give good advixe and not be charging you anything people?  Really?  Furthermore, they treat their superstar higjly experienced people the same as the ones they are getting rid of. It's all about brown nosing at that place. Quality employees leave within 24 months.

Since there's no time for a consultative approach when managers expect you to take as many calls as possible--- and because there's no need for a consultative approach when an IRA is always the answer--- phone interactions result in the same canned pitch over and over.

Managers and Guidance Support Specialists coach to numbers only. Customer satisfaction surveys somehow no longer matter. Site wide departmental sales performance reports are routinely e-mailed to the group and posted on white boards near team areas. Stats reports (number of calls handled, average handle time, etc.) are e-mailed daily. Associates are even required to keep a running personal daily tally and turn it in each week as a sort of unofficial reporting mechanism which is still e-mailed out to the team.

Within the Workplace Guidance business unit there is also a drive that pits all sites against one another, competitively speaking. Westlake prides itself on being ""relentless"" and even encourages dishonest tactics to provide an unfair advantage such as working unscheduled overtime in order to take more phonecalls than other sites.",10

Running itself into the ground,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW9008152.htm,1.0,"Dec 27, 2015",Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,Pros,"The benefits (401, medical, etc) are above standard for most employers. They're also the most likely firm to get you to pass a series 7 if you have no finance experience or degree to fall back on. If you can handle call center work there is some job mobility in that function, just don't expect to get into the back office or anything beyond a phone unless you're a lucky duck destined for management.",Cons,"Where to begin...The mantra being preached to new hires is that your contribution matters and you're helping our customers just by answering the call. In reality, training is now so utterly warped and schizophrenic that you likely will need a promotion above the entry level position to assist with anything more complicated than cutting a check or trading a mutual fund. Consequently, it is absolutely crushing that you can't help half the customers that wait hours in line to get to you and that's even worse when you first start to where you transfer 95% of your calls. Management is unhelpful and most of the call center managers you honestly scratch your head at what they actually do other than go to meetings and give you self-directed coaching assignments. As with any call center, metrics are King. I got promoted entirely because I got through calls fast and didn't ask questions only for the next role to be even worse. Certain departments (core/hnw services mainly) have forced overtime right now that is held against you if you don't meet the supposed goal or have other activities that prevent you from doing so. The new systems internally have also taken hold times and raised them exponentially because of the new/barely trained reps having to transfer everything and attrition causes old reps to leave for jobs outside of fidelity or internal promotions with the stress the new system has lumped on them from new hires being functionally useless. Volumes aren't even as bad as they were last year but it's still a high stress job that keeps you tied to a cubicle having to apologize to clients for management failing to see the problem in changing the entire service model at the busy time of year when clients are already in a hurry and coming in in droves. The money isn't enough to make this worthwhile.",10

When you have down time due to testing environments not working, you have some time to build worthwhile skills for a new job.",Cons,"Test environments are horrible - It is impossible to actually test. They are always changing code that breaks things with no accountability. Client Configurations are always getting messed up. It's impossible to test a product completely. Random error messages every day. It is extremely frustrating to be in this type of environment and you will be stuck waiting for dev/systems to fix issues on a daily basis.

No advancement opportunities within DB - They will gladly allocate you to 120% because they like to ""run lean"", but they don't like to actually recognize employees monetarily. If you ever do get a promotion within the team, don't expect a good pay raise.

Atrocious raises - With each year the raises are getting worse. After leading major projects and putting in a bunch of overtime, I was presented with a 1.5% raise. Others received worse percentages. Make sure you haggle on your starting salary, because you will be at that same pay until you get out of the department.

No incentives - The only incentive is if you are hourly and can work overtime. Otherwise, you won't get recognized and there will be some time of excuse why raises/bonuses are low despite making record profits. I don't know many coworkers that want to stay in the department.

Cheap - When they do encourage team bonding, they make it known that it is NOT funded and that you have to pay. Example - lunch outings with new teammates will be talked about for a week in advance and is highly encouraged to attend, but you will have to pay for yourself. When they used to acknowledge birthdays within the group, the cakes had to be bought personally by management without being able to expense them. 

Benefits - There are health benefits, but they have increased ~220% within 2 years. So you make less money by staying with the company. If you want any type of health reimbursement, you have to track your daily fitness/diet/etc; which they do reimburse $125/quarter, but it is very time consuming

Menial tasks/job - The job itself is very menial. Other departments test a lot more that seem to overlap. You will not build any skills with this position. The hardest part of the job is understanding the complex systems, and when you have a good idea how they should function, they do not actually work. You spend most of your time writing defects. Each environment has limitations that seem to fluctuate per project. You will not build any skills that will help you develop professionally and could hinder future opportunities.

Access issues - There are so many different systems that you need access to. You will not know that you need access to a specific table/environment/program/system until you lose it and can't access something. Then you have to wait days in order for them to give you access permissions again. 

You will be ""voluntold"" to participate in certain tasks that are not related to your role (or even department), have no prior knowledge of and are projected to ""only take 4 hours"", but they end up taking multiple weeks while you still have project work to maintain. That will be on addition to the 120% allocation that you already have for projects as well. 

The main application used in DB is 20+ years old. The code is basically all patchwork to fix problems on top of problems. There's ""known issues"" within certain functionality that isn't actually known among teams until a high-level dev informs the teams.",9

Destroying value for the customer and itself every day,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW134871.htm,1.0,"Dec 18, 2008",Financial Analyst,Current Employee,"Marlborough, MA",Pros,"A reputable name for your resume, more job responsibility for future pursuits than you'll know what to do with, and because of its multiple businesses it is especially great if you are looking for a quasi-career change (jumping from say marketing to advertising, accounting to finance, or finance to investments, etc)",Cons,"Let's get right to it -- Fidelity hasn't yet learned the truth that 1 smart person can perform the work of 3 idiots, while actually managing to create value instead of destroying it.  They love people who are completely satisfied being a middle-level contributor or entry-level manager for the rest of their lives, and although they will pay for your graduate degrees, actually going to night school scares the bejesus out of managers and will put you on the fast track to career stagflation -- an interesting paradox where the amount of work given to you rises exponentially and yet your career advancement aspects stagnate.

They will work you to the bone, give you extremely little attention in terms of career guidance and feedback, and will make you feel like you're asking them to donate a kidney whenever you book vacation time or (god forbid) take a sick day.  Essentially you are a highly trained, but easily replaceable, workhorse for them that can be put to sleep when they can find someone in another state or country that will take your job for less money, even if they can't produce the same standards of output.

The CFOs -- yes plural, as Fidelity brands everyone who manages 100 people a CFO of this or that department -- developed a breakthrough management realization; if you don't promote people, you don't have compensation expenses increase.  Targeted goals this year were <3% compensation increases -- inclusive of salary increases from promotions!

It goes without saying the firm is losing most of its top talent.  Unfortunately with salary for individual contributors 40% below market rates to satisfy Fidelity's precondition to feed senior management, top performers get replaced with completely ignorant and unqualified associates when they leave.  As an example to this absurdity, 2 top analysts in a group quit when they were asked to take on additional workload after already working 60 hour weeks on average, despite not having received a promotion in 2-3 years from junior analyst to senior analyst.  Their combined positions were replaced by a ""senior analyst"" who was so inept they could not even figure out how to rename computer files or put paper into a printer (I kid you not), and who had never worked in a financial services role before.

In closing, the source of the other reviews on this company pretty much sums it up:  management loves it, individual contributors think it’s a joke.  Anyone thinking about coming to this company within their first 10 years of career experience should think of one thing and one thing only.  ""Who am I REALLY going to work for, once I get Fidelity to pay for my FINRA registration?""  If you don't have a 1-2 year exit strategy, enjoy becoming one of Fidelity's many 40-50 year old junior/senior associates who will never even make it to middle management.",8

If you are a glutton for punishment go for it. It was by far the worst working experience of my life and I am so glad I left. I had always worked for smaller, entreprenurial type companies where there was real opportunity if you worked hard and could produce. This culture does not exist at Fidelity, at least not in the role I was in. They do have decent benefits so that would be a reason to work there and if you are looking for P/T you only have to work 30 hours per week to be eligible for the benefits (80% paid by Fidelity). They also do have the option of working 4 ten hour days or even 3 ten hour days if you are so inclined so that is something that may be appealing.",Cons,"Worst job of my life. Long hard days that are incredibly boring taking call after call and answering the same four or five questions over and over. They micro manage you to the minute (literally) and tell you when to eat or take a break. That might appeal to some but for me that was the first time I had been in such a repressive position. I felt like a slave. And the compensation is terrible. I made more in my first year out of school ten years ago than I made at Fidelity and I am fully licensed (Series 6 and 63). I mainly took the job out of curiosity. I was new to the area (NC) and had never worked for a huge company before so I wanted to see what it was like. Thanks to Fidelity I will never again work for a company with more than 100 employees. To recent college grads......trust me....there is much better opportunities out there and I would run, not walk, from any offer that Fidelity makes you.

Ridiculous.
Firm has a stranglehold on employees financial life - and by extension the rest of employee's family also. Red tape upon red tape to make trades in personal ROTH or investment accounts - and onerous disclosure requirements (4 times a year) to meet a standard intended for Fund managers - not Sysadmins.
Morale in the tank. Lowest I've ever seen it in 11+ years. Excellent environment if you want to ensure you retain the poor talent and ensure the best talent leaves the company.
For example: Keep putting out ungodly levels of production.. and oh, by the way - no merit raises regardless of your rating or value to the firm -- and year end bonus (a significant incentive to reach stated goals) is a big question mark. Therefore highest performers treated exactly the same as poorest performers.

Salary and benefits better than average but Fidelity has made many changes to reduce these in recent years (i.e. elimination of pension plan; change in merit and bonus review program; move to high deductible medical plan).,Cons,"Fidelity is a sweatshop.  If you job involves client services, you find yourself working on vacation and holidays with no appreciation or reward.  Fidelity has been doing consistent reductions in force over the last several years so less employees do more work.  The company also recycles the same managers year after year which do nothing but provide lip service to upper management.  The old boys club rules at Fidelity.  If you are part of the club you are in.  However, if you are honest and speak the truth, you are out.  Senior management does not want to hear the truth and doesn't care about what the rank and file employees want or need or for that matter what the clients need.  On the institutional side of the business, what is best for the client is what is in the best interest of Fidelity.  
Client Boards are just ways for senior management to goes to posh hotels/locations to schmooze with clients and give them lip service.  Recent changes in the merit review process results in most employees being rated as average.  This review process is a bell curve so only a handful are rated as excellent and requires that some employees fall into the need to improve category.  This certainly makes it easy to determine who is out for the continual reductions in force.  Finally, if you manage clients beware that if that client leaves, the buck stops with you.  Even if the decision is out of your control (i.e. senior management won't budge on pricing or the client is bought by another company that is not with Fidelity) your manager will hold you accountable and your job will be on the line.",7

PTO and VTO,  FMLA
Maternity leave 6-7 months, Paternity leave about a month I think. 
Lots of OT for second shift.",Cons,"Discriminates against pregnant women and then penalizes you and shames you for having to pee frequently. 
Gives too much VTO and doesn’t anticipate proper staffing to help cover 2nd shift at night. 
Pressures employees to do the impossible and demands perfection yet pays crap, and doesn’t even listen to their employees.
PTO can only be planned. They get angry if you have to take sick days. 
They don’t actually give credit to outstanding employees like they should. I was supposed to get a VOC award but the manager who took it never submitted it even after multiple requests. 
They refuse to change your schedule.
The company says they’re family friendly but they really aren’t. 
They force you to sign a sort of gag order which means you’re not allowed to tell incoming employees or potential employees how bad it is while you work there up to a year after you leave.

They expect you to do all of these ridiculous things during a call, jump through hoops in a quick and timely manner however also need to be able to connect with callers while being verbally abused. 
The work environment is a little toxic. Feels like high school. If you’re not in someone’s click then you’re alone. If you’re pregnant they do give you a generous maternity leave however they are prejudice against you if you’re pregnant or become so. I had to constantly get up and go to the bathroom and had severe vertigo, because of that I wasn’t taking calls which caused my stats to go down. I was constantly pulled aside and “coached”, a polite way of reprimanding, and told that I, a pregnant woman, needed to hold it till my breaks. When I called HR about it I was told other pregnant women were held to the same standards, yet my own sister in law was almost fired because of the same issues. Every pregnant woman I’ve known who worked this position quit because of the discrimination. Doing a lawsuit against the company would be pointless because they can just say I wasn’t adhering to my required stats and NH is an at will state.
Word to the wise, don’t plan on starting a family while working on the floor. They will use every excuse under the sun as to why you can’t transfer departments or grow in the company and why you can’t get a different shift. I was 1:30-9:30pm. After I got pregnant I needed to change my schedule because I couldn’t drive at night. But again I was denied. 
I left the company because my mental health tanked so low from verbally abusive callers and an employer who didn’t care about what was going on and from being isolated because it’s like high school, and I was refused a shift change that I desperately needed.",7

If you're an FTE ""regular employee"" they still have a great benefit package: excellent health plan, 401k with match, profit-sharing.",Cons,"You're not going to get an FTE position, never mind keep one if you have it. They've pushed out almost all the competent managers, and have stuck individual contributors as ""perma-temps"" with horrible/no benefits. The ""perma-temp"" medical plans stop paying at $5000 even though advertised as $50,000, so don't plan on getting sick or injured.  FTE to ""perma-temp"" ratio is the worst I've seen in 15 years there.

Reorgs coming fast and furious. 4 Managers in 1 year. Raleigh was to be the new Tech HQ and now there are no managers left there, just bodyshop L1 Visa holders, perma-temps of their captive Veritude ""temp"" agency, and a few FTEs. Hundreds laid off again just this past week across the company, following last year's 10% 4000 person cut, and several ""stealth layoffs"" between then and now. Most of the very experienced people, especially if they are over 40, have been dumped. 

There is absolutely no sense to who they're dumping, if they were sincerely still trying to run and grow the company. They're just cleaning up the balance sheet to make the company's financials look good, in my opinion. 

The old-school Wall Streeters who came in to take over from the long-term Boston exec mgmt have now themselves started bailing out of the firm. There's nothing left of last year's 5-year plan except the souvenir mouse pads showing the cartoon of the transformation plan. On which we had to take mandatory training!",6

Managers did not care about their employees (except for their ""favorites"") and never provided any training that could help you to move up through the company.

Advancing your career is basically impossible.  If you are content making a very low salary for an extended period of time while being stuck in an entry level job into your 30's (yes I saw a lot of this) then Fidelity is for you.

A lot of manual effort from disconnected systems and lack of information goes into completing daily work.,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Fidelity-Investments-RVW748160.htm,1.0,"Dec 20, 2010",Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"Merrimack, NH",Pros,"It's a good way to get a wide variety of experiences and assignments. There is always so much that's broken, so it's ripe with opportunities for improvement. There is a high frequency of change, which can also be challenging.  The environment at Fidelity is very friendly for those who work and play well with others regardless of how poorly you do your job. Overall, a pretty safe environment.",Cons,"Fidelity has a lot of legacy software and hardware platforms, so it's not the place to be if you are interested in getting experienced with newer technologies or automation. Fidelity is addicted to faulty systems which require high levels of maintenance and manual effort, because they can get them ""cheaply"" through volume discounts and enterprise licensing. Approximately 15% of your time on the job will be required for mandatory ""ethics"" and ""compliance"" training, double-recording your time and work results in disconnected, deficient, and faulty systems. The ethics training is as much a joke as the company's stated values, which include honesty. As long as you aren't tossing midgets or taking kickbacks, honesty is not even valued (especially amongst management), much less promoted in ANY way. I personally know of managers who are told by upper management to lie to their employees. I'm not sure how ""ethics"" can even exist in such an inherently dishonest environment.
By the time you complete all of the ""mandatory training"" and administrative tasks required, you will be lucky to have 60% of your time left to do your job. They will schedule enough meetings to consume another 20% of your time, but management will still treat it as 100%.  Of course, while trying to complete your job tasks in this remaining 40% of your time, you will also be expected to train offshore staff how to do your job.  The offshore staff is culturally trained to say ""yes"" to everything and then delivering on 10-20% of what they promise.  But it's okay, because they are perceived as being ""cheap labor"", even though they can't seem to work independently and require that you do about 40% of the job for them.  A significant amount of time on the job is also wasted ""shifting gears"", as management is largely incompetent and doesn't understand the costs associated with changing your mind and focus constantly. Often, fake deadlines are created and things given an overblown sense of importance to pressure employees into working late. Many times I have arrived at work and started to work on an ""important"" task perhaps less than 1 hour in duration and still struggled to focus through the constant interruptions to complete this before the end of the work day, which is often late into the evening. My boss interrupts me 6 - 8 times a day for ""emergencies"", and then becomes upset because ""he doesn't know what I am working on"".
Penny-wise and pound foolish, Fidelity purchases systems based solely on the purchase price and doesn't seem to know the 1st thing about TCO (Total Cost of Ownership).  They build lavish and expensive bathrooms, while looking for ways to cut expense reimbursement, benefits, and bonuses, while they make billions shipping American jobs overseas. They have contributed significantly to the infrastructure and economy in India while they add to the unemployment lines domestically.
Talk about a hostile work environment! Making your boss look good here is the only thing that counts. The company's core values are an absolute joke, as is their dental plan, ""ethics"", and ""compliance"" training. Rather than focus on getting results, motivating employees and doing the right thing, managers spend their time sneaking up behind employees to see what's on their computer screen. If they see a similar screen that might have been there 2 hours before, the assumption is made that you have done nothing else within that 2 hour period, even though there are electronic records of all systems usage. Why check when it's easier for them to assume?
If you are technically incompetent and can lie like a politician, there is a comfy home for you in management at Fidelity. Once you're a member in this exclusive club, it's all about you and other than committing career-icide through political folly, there will be nothing you can do wrong. 
Also, if you ever want to invest on your own, Fidelity will make sure that whatever gains you might make will be more than offset by the paperwork, administrative hassles and threats to your employment status from their ""compliance"" department. And that's only IF they pre-approve every trade that you make.",3

A general willingness to invest in business development and IT. Modern and updated facilities with decent amenities. Tight security both physically and on the customer data side.,Cons,"Does not pay for performance or set performance expectations well. There are unwritten or absent expectations regarding ""success"" in job roles; performance is not necessarily judged against what your assignments are and how you execute them. 

For example, recently I had achieved all of my performance goals for the review period, such as being ahead of project completion schedules, under budget and delivered targeted business scope. Two weeks prior to the performance review the performance assessment criteria was changed to ""measure"" me against targets that I had no chance to meet since they were completely different than the job assignments.  The manager conducting the review admitted that the assessment criteria was ""new"" and ""unfair"" and the lack of communication was deliberate in order to send a ""message"" to the organization.

After over a decade of service with eighty percent of my performance reviews being ""above average"" under the various grading scales (and never having had a poor review before), it was a very strange turn of events.

It appears as though it may be a targeted ""reduction in force"" or ""desired attrition"" by targeting people at certain pay and/or years of service, since I was only one of several colleagues who held similar positions that expressed a very similar situation. 

Rewards are more and more concentrated at the very top level, with the middle layer becoming hollow and the entry level positions are subject to RIF's regularly.
